The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) announced Tuesday the
establishment of the first national-level "industrial safety
awards" as an incentive for businesses and individuals to promote
safety and hygiene in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the awards will be presented annually to 10
businesses and individuals that perform best in this regard, CLA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The awards will be divided into several categories, including
state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, small- and medium-
sized businesses, individuals and public construction, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said promoting industrial safety is a
matter that can allow for no delay because only if the lives of
workers are protected will their families remain intact.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government should grant the highest honor to those
who are committed to enhancing safety and hygiene in the
workplace, Lee said.
