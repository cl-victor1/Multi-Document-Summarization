President Chen Shui-bian pledged Wednesday to provide support for
the Legal Aid Foundation as he lauded the group for protecting
the legal rights of disadvantaged people.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while receiving members of the foundation
at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the legal aid system does not simply help people
handle lawsuits, Chen said it is also important that the system
serves as a reminder for the public and the government to reflect
upon the problems faced by people when dealing with the judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment two-and-a-half years ago, the foundation
has set up 20 branches around Taiwan and has handled a total of
nearly 25,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
However, the president pointed out that the foundation is not
large enough to provide help for more people in need and he
promised to provide more resources and funds.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the foundation can further improve
the public's understanding of the law in addition to providing
lawyers to represent them.
