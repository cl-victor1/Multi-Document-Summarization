ANTIBIOTICS FOUND EFFECTIVE IN SOME HIGH-GRADE MALTOMA CASES

High-grade gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma
(MALToma) can be cured with antibiotic therapy before it spreads,
according to a recent study by the National Taiwan University
Hospital (NTUH) and National Health Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The results were released to local press Monday, after The
Journal of Pathology published the findings in its January issue.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the team, Cheng Ann-lii who is also the deputy
director of NTUH's Department of Oncology said that up till now,
patients with helicobacter pylori- related low-grade gastric
MALToma were treated with antibiotics, while high- grade MALToma
patients, whether the tumor had spread or not, have had no other
choice but undergoing generalized chemotherapy for at least six
months.
</P>
<P>
However, Cheng said, following the study, which extended over a
two-year period, they concluded that 50 to 70 percent of patients
with high-grade MALToma could be cured by a simpler, less-painful
antibiotic therapy before signs of spreading appeared.
</P>
<P>
Cheng called the beginning of the research a "pure coincidence."
He related that a 49-year-old female Taiwanese scholar was
diagnosed with high-grade MALToma in the United States about a
decade ago. Refusing the course of chemotherapy recommended  by
the U.S. physician, she turned to NTUH to find alternative
treatments.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the scholar was given a period of antibiotic therapy.
Her gastric ulcer and tumor were gone after six weeks and her
stomach returned to normal after 16 months. She has had no
relapse since, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The case inspired the NTHU team to undertake further study, he
said. The team then conducted a clinical experiment with 34
patients with low-grade cases and 24 patients with high-grade
cases, and the results showed that 97 percent of low-grade
patients, and 92 percent of high-grade patients were cured.
Moreover, only one-eighth of the low-grade patients experienced a
relapsed, whereas none of those with high-grade afflictions did.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cheng said, follow-up experiments produced less
satisfying results, which prompted them to investigate further
into the crux of the problem and improve the effectiveness of the
therapy. Currently, the cure rate has stabilized at between 50
and 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a recent project, the team has found two biomarkers -- BCL10
and NF-kB -- that can spot the pathogen of MALTome -- TNF-alpha.
If the inflammation caused by TNF-alpha can be stopped, the cure
rate is be even higher, Cheng said.
