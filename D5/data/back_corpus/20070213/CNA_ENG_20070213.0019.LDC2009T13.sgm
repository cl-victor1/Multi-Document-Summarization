There will be greater supplies of fruits, vegetables and flowers
available in domestic markets during the five-day period in the
lead up to the Chinese New Year holiday, officials of the
Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with average levels, an increase of 46 percent will be
seen in vegetable supplies during this period, while there will
be a 53 percent greater supply of fruits, and 137 percent more
flowers, the officials assessed, noting that the AFA has asked
farmers to increase supplies to meet an expected increase in
demand before the week-long Chinese New Year holiday that will
begin on New Year's Eve Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
Chinese New Year's Day, which falls on Feb. 18 this year, is one
of the most important festivals in Taiwan, with many families
preparing traditional feasts for the festival. Owing to the fact
that wholesale markets for agricultural products will be closed
during the holiday, most people are expected to engage in a
shopping spree in preparation for the holiday break.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the demand for agricultural products is expected to
peak during the approach of the Chinese New Year festival, AFA
officials said.
