The Ministry of Education (MOE) has adopted various measures
aimed at enhancing the learning efficiency and adaptability of
school children with a foreign-born parent, whose numbers are
rising in the country owing to the increase in the number of
mixed marriages, a ministry official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
These  measures  include  priority  enrollment  in  public
kindergartens for these children and providing them with after-
school care  and  guidance, according  to  Yang  Chang-yu,
deputy director-general  of the  ministry's Department  of
Elementary Education.

While a total of 6,363 children with a foreign-born parent are
enrolled in public kindergartens for the 2006-2007 academic year,
19,943 have joined the after-school programs, Yang said.

Yang said the results of a study show that although the
performance of children with a foreign-born parent is not as good
as that of other children when they first enter school because of
their weaker Chinese language ability and their lower socio-
economic status, these children gradually catch up as they
advance to higher grades.
</P>
<P>
In addition to taking steps to help the children improve their
academic performance, the ministry is also encouraging schools to
hold activities, such as a cultural week and an international
week, to allow children from families with two Taiwan parents to
learn about different cultures, Yang said.

<P>
Stressing that children from mixed marriages deserve just as much
respect as other children, he said the cultural activities will
allow students to appreciate cultural diversity and enhance
cultural exchanges and assimilation.

<P>
A report released by the ministry last month said that as the
fertility rate among foreign spouses has been increasing, an
average of one in every eight newborns in Taiwan has a foreign-
born parent.
</P>
<P>
The number of elementary and junior high school students with a
foreign-born parent has also jumped 1.8-fold over the past four
years, from 30,040 in the 2003-2004 academic year to more than
80,000 in the 2006-2007 academic year, according to the report.
