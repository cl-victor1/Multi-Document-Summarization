WORLD COMMUNITY URGED NOT TO IGNORE TAIWAN'S QUARANTINE RIGHTS

Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA) 02/13/07  20:09:26 (By Elisa Kao)

President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that it will be regrettable
for the whole world if Taiwan becomes a global quarantine
loophole should it continue to be excluded from the World Health
Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at a meeting with Lord Howell of Guildford,
deputy leader of Britain's Conservative Party in the House of
Lords, in which the president also expressed gratitude to Howell
for his long-term support for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Howell's support, the British House of Commons
released a pro- Taiwan report in August last year suggesting that
the government help Taiwan join the World Health Assembly (WHA)
-- the decision-making body of the WHO -- as an observer and
increase its political interaction with Taiwan, Chen went on.

<P>
On the global anti-avian flu efforts, Chen said Taiwan has been
making great efforts in this regard, including the organization
of three high-level anti-bird flu meetings during the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is one of the few countries that put anti-bird flu work on
the level of national security. It is still free from bird flu,
Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan and Britain share the values of democracy,
human rights and peace and have close exchanges in trade,
education, tourism and culture, Chen expressed hope that the two
countries can establish closer cooperation ties in sanitation,
quarantine and health care.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that some of the treasures of the British Museum are
being exhibited at the National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei
and that Britain is Taiwan's third-largest trade partner in
Europe, while Taiwan is Britain's ninth-largest export market in
the Asia-Pacific region.
