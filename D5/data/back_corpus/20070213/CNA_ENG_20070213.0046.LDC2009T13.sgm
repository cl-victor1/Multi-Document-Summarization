Council of Agriculture (COA) Vice Minister Tai Chen-yao said
Tuesday that Taiwan should develop high-tech and recreational
agriculture to enhance its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Tai made the remarks at a seminar organized in Yunlin County,
southern Taiwan, by the Wu San-Lian Historical Foundation on
Taiwan's history and industries, in which the participants
expressed concern over the future of the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Noting  that many countries  attach  great  importance  to
agricultural reform and development, Tai said industrially
advanced countries like Germany, Britain, the United States and
Japan have injected a great deal of funds and personnel into
agriculture to maintain sustainable agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should focus its efforts on developing agricultural
products with local uniqueness through high technology, and
dedicate energy to developing recreational agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Tai expressed regret that some Taiwan businessmen have
taken the country's agricultural high technology to China.
