The Chinese Taipei Sailing Association (CTSA) purchased 50
Optimist dinghies Friday with money provided by the National
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) in an effort to
promote the sport of sailing in schools.

<P>
The dinghies will be presented to 24 junior high schools and
elementary schools in 10 cities and counties around the country,
CTSA Chairman Wang Chin-chung said at a press conference marking
the purchase.

<P>
The association hopes the move will trigger a trend of sailing on
campuses and draw the attention of local governments to the
promotion of maritime sports, Wang said.

<P>
NCPFS officials also attended the press conference.

Optimist dinghy is one of Asian Games' official competition
events for athletes aged under 15, and a basic type of small
sailing boat, Wang said, indicating that most medal-winning
skippers in Asian Games and Olympics were former Optimist
sailors.
