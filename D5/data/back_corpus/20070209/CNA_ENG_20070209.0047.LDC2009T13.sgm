The non-profit  Consumer's  Foundation  checked 51 hot pot
ingredient samples, mostly fish balls and Japanese-style surimi
products, bought from supermarkets, shopping malls and
traditional markets around the greater Taipei area from November
through January, it said.
</P>
<P>
Around 80 percent of the samples contained 400 mg to 800 mg of
sodium per 100 g, the foundation said, while a government
regulation on packaged food recommends a daily sodium intake of
2,400 mg.
</P>
<P>
One surimi product surveyed contained 1,100 mg of sodium per 100
g, the foundation said, adding that eating only a little over a
dozen of the products can mean ingesting about 2,400 mg of
sodium, without even counting the salt contained in seasonings.
</P>
<P>
The checks also found use of preservatives in around 40 percent
of the samples, with two products exceeding legal standards, the
foundation said.
