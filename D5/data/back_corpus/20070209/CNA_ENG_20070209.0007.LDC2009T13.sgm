52 IDLE PUBLIC FACILITIES REVITALIZED: PCC CHIEF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/09/07  12:09:05 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The Public Construction Commission (PCC) has successfully
assisted local governments in reviving 52 idle public facilities
around the country over the past couple of years, a senior
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
All of these revitalized public facilities were originally built
for a total cost of NT$13.78 billion (US$417.58 million) , PCC
Chairman Wu Tze-cheng said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, 96 idle or underused public facilities are still
listed for revitalization, redevelopment or demolition.
</P>
<P>
To show the government's determination to resolve the issue and
save public funds, Wu said, Premier Su Tseng-chang has instructed
the PCC to further review all the listed facilities to determine
whether they should be redeveloped. "The premier is not opposed
to the demolition of those facilities for which redevelopment is
not warranted," he added.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that many idle or underused public facilities were by-
products of election politics, Wu said the facilities were mostly
built for the sake of winning voter support in elections without
making any "down-to-earth" evaluation of practical market demand.
</P>
<P>
Citing the example of the construction of parking lots in each
township or village, Wu said many of the parking facilities have
been left idle or underused as local governments have never
seriously cracked down on parking violations.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments' inefficient management of public facilities
has not only resulted in a waste of public resources but has also
affected  local people's confidence  and trust in the central
government," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Executive Yuan has formed a special task force to
review the feasibility of redeveloping or transforming idle
public facilities, Wu said that if possible, private operators
will be introduced to manage idle parking lots, swimming pools,
exhibition halls and other public facilities.
