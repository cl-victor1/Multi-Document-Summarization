Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/09/07  19:36:45 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Friday that
promoting a name change campaign in the international community
is aimed at "proper partition" from China.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the campaign is a bid to avoid the international
community or the nation's allies from mistaking Taiwan for China
or vice versa, claiming that it is not out of "ideological
concerns, " but "out of pragmatic considerations."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States has expressed concern over the
campaign, Huang said the U.S. had not expressed any views.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it was not appropriate for him to comment on
the matter as it is an internal issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the "name rectification" issue plagues Taiwan as well as
China, citing the examples that when Chinese President Hu Jintao
visited the United States last year, the master of the welcoming
ceremony announced to play the national anthem of "the Republic
of China," instead of "the People's Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
Also, when Hu recently visited Grenade, an island nation in the
southeastern Caribbean Sea, the band played the national anthem
of "the Republic of China" instead of the "People's Republic of
China," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the campaign is not a new development, saying that
it has been in the making over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan has communicated with its allies and that
currently, Taiwan's embassies have "Taiwan" in parenthesis as
part of their names.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has continued to coordinate with nations with which it
does not maintain diplomatic relations and has made substantial
progress, he said without elaborating.
