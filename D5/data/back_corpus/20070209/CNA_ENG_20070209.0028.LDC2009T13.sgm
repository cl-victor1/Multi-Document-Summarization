The Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Agriculture
(COA) have been working on the popular "Five a Day" plan to
promote a lifestyle of eating at least five servings of
vegetables and fruit per day, a DOH official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Huei-wen, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
said the DOH and the COA are promoting the plan by releasing
convenience packs containing three vegetables and two fruits in
stores such as Carrefours and agricultural product marketing
centers, in an effort to make vegetables and fruit easier for
consumers to buy.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the DOH shows that 96 percent of Taiwanese
realize the importance of balanced nutrition, but 80 percent do
not eat enough fruit and vegetables, especially those who eat
out. The investigation also revealed that convenient buying
channels would increase consumption.
</P>
<P>
Cheng pointed out that insufficient intake of dietary fiber
causes constipation and increase the risk of colorectal cancer,
chronic and cardiovascular diseases. Consuming at least three
servings (about 300 grams) of vegetables and two servings (about
200 grams) of fruit contributes to good health.
</P>
<P>
The DOH will also call on government authorities, companies and
food suppliers to join this plan and encourage the consumption of
more vegetables and fruit.
