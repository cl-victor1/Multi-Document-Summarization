EXECUTIVE YUAN TO STEP IN IF NCC ALLOWS KMT TO SELL RADIO STATION

Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA) 02/09/07  19:13:08 (By Maubo Chang)

<P>
The Executive Yuan will step in if the National Communications
Commission (NCC) allows the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to sell
its Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) , a spokesman for the
Executive Yuan warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wen-tsang, minister of the Government Information Office
(GIO) , said the Executive Yuan has ordered the NCC to instruct
the BCC to fulfill its promise to hand back the two radio
frequencies it uses and not to sell its property before a lawsuit
brought by the Executive Yuan against it is settled.
</P>
<P>
Although the NCC agreed to relieve the BCC of its obligation to
carry out the promises  in a settlement  in the Taipei High
Administrative Court late last year, the Executive Yuan is
mulling whether to cancel the settlement after a three-member
panel led by Minister-without-Portfolio  Hsu Chih-hsiung
determined that the agreement between the NCC and BCC was
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said Premier Su Tseng-chang has repeatedly instructed the
NCC to take back BCC's radio frequencies, thereby foiling the
KMT's scheme to sell off its ill- gotten assets.
</P>
<P>
The BCC, which made the promises in 2004 to the GIO in return for
the GIO's renewal of its operating license, asked the court to
annul the promises after the KMT sold the company to a private
radio operator last year, claiming that the GIO abused its power
by coercing it into making the promises.
</P>
<P>
The NCC, which was founded in 2006 to take over the GIO's
business of supervising the country's broadcasting companies,
agreed in court to cancel the GIO's requests in return for BCC's
withdrawal of a lawsuit asking for government compensation for
damages.
