TAIWAN NEEDS F-16 FIGHTERS TO COUNTER CHINA'S MILITARY THREAT:
MAC

Washington,  Feb.  8 (CNA) 02/09/07  16:32:39 (By Jorge Liu and
Y.F. Low)

A Taiwan official urged the United States Thursday to approve the
sale of new F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan, saying Taiwan needs
to acquire the aircraft to beef up its ability to defend itself
against China's military threat.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks during an interview with U.S. cable television station
C-span, in the wake of a Defense News report that the Bush
administration has refused to sell 66 F-16 C/D fighter aircraft
requested by Taiwan because Washington is unhappy with Taiwan's
delay in its procurement of diesel-electric submarines, P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
batteries from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the production of J-10A fighter aircraft by China
has significantly upgraded China's air force and directly
threatens the security of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With China continuing  to expand its military  deployments
targeting Taiwan, the number of short-range ballistic missiles
deployed by China along its coast opposite Taiwan has increased
from several hundred to more than 1,000, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wu said the number of submarines owned by China is
far larger than its actual demand, which he said is evidence of
China's intention to launch a naval blockade of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that not only Taiwan but also other countries in East
Asia and even the whole world have also felt China's military
ambitions, citing the successful anti-satellite weapons test by
China as an example.
</P>
<P>
Wu admitted that the Bush administration's refusal to sell the
F-16 C/D fighter aircraft to Taiwan is related to the delay of
the previous arms procurement package.
</P>
<P>
He said the Legislative Yuan is expected to pass part of the
budget for the procurement package in the new legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
Also during the interview, Wu called Washington's attention to
the rapid expansion of China's influence in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In particular, it is a development deserving international
concern that China is engaging with countries with poor human
rights records such as Sudan and Zimbabwe, Wu said.
