<P>
China's substantial military budget increase has threatened peace
across the Taiwan Strait, Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-
tsang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks after China unveiled its 2007 budget plan
last weekend that showed its military spending will register a
17.8 percent year-on-year rise.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's military budget has continued a double-digit
growth since 1993, Cheng said its threat to Taiwan's security has
been rising accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Cheng further said China's intensified military buildup doesn't
comply with its claim to pursue a peaceful rise. "Beijing leaders
are saying one thing and doing another," he added.
</P>
<P>
With no apparent imminent threat or potential future threat to
its security in sight, Cheng went on China should be held
accountable for its sharp military budget increase.
</P>
<P>
The international  community  should push China to enhance
transparency in its military affairs or military buildup moves,
Cheng said, adding that China should explain in detail the
purposes of its huge military budget hike for 2007.
