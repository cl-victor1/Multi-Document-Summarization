BILL CONCERNING CHUNGHWA POST'S NAME CHANGE BLOCKED AT
LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>

Opposition "pan-blue" lawmakers blocked Tuesday a draft amendment
to postal regulations that is needed to implement a controversial
proposal to change the designation of Chunghwa Post Co., from
being placed on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
The state-run enterprise's board of directors passed the proposal
to change the company's name to Taiwan Post last month, amid
protests of company workers. However, the name change cannot be
carried out without an amendment to regulations governing postal
administration and Chunghwa (which means Chinese in Mandarin)
Post's statutes.
</P>
<P>
At the Legislative Yuan Procedure Committee, legislators of the
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party,
who hold a slim majority in the legislature, forced out the draft
bill, frustrating the government's ongoing drive to "rectify"
names of state-run bussinesses to get rid of Chinese references
in their titles and add the word "Taiwan" to make them more
identifiable with their country of orgin and avoid confusion with
similiarly named Chinese organizations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the legislative committee also shut out an unrelated
proposal of the "pan green camp", headed by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, to ask the Legislative Yuan to exercise its
power of consent over the president's nominees for long vacant
seats in the Control Yuan, the country's supreme watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan has not been operating for more than two years
because of the opposition-controlled legislature's refusal to
endorse President Chen Shui- bian's nominations.
