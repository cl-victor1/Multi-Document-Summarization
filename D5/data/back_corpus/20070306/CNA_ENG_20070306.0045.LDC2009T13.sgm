LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER IN NO HURRY TO ANNOUNCE PRESIDENTIAL BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  22:03:28 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that he is in
no hurry to declare his presidential bid because it is still too
"early" to talk about the issue.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a stalwart in the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who has
been widely assumed to be a strong contender to former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou in the competition for the party's
nomination for the 2008 presidential election, said that he needs
more time to weigh his next move amid many variable
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would meet with Ma again to discuss pairing up
on a KMT presidential ticket at the invitation of KMT Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan, Wang make it clear that he will accept Lien's
invitation and try his best to be cooperative in the coming
meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Wang was reserved about whether a positive outcome would be
produced afterwards on the ground that "it depends on whether the
mediation process would be acceptable to both sides."
</P>
<P>
Through Lien's mediation, Wang met with Ma for this very purpose
last month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Lien has been seeking to push Ma and Wang to
form a ticket to contest the 2008 presidential race, despite a
widespread belief that the two KMT bigwigs have been at odds for
some time. Speculation has it that Ma and Wang could form the
KMT's presidential ticket through either a primary election or
direct negotiations between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
Wang is the last of the major players from both ruling and
opposition parties who has yet to officially make public his
presidential intentions.
</P>
<P>
The DPP's major contenders have all announced their presidential
bids and Ma has also proclaimed his desire to run for the next
presidency, saying it is his inescapable responsibility to bring
the KMT back to power in 2008.
