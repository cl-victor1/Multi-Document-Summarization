'FOUR WANTS' NOT POLICY ABOUT-FACE: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 5 (CNA) 03/06/07  11:01:16 (By Sofia Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian's "four wants, one without"  statement
is  an explanation  of his  longstanding Taiwan-centric policies
and by no means marks an about-face, a Presidential Office
spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a dinner party held in Taipei Sunday to celebrate the
25th founding anniversary of the Washington-based pro-
independence Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) ,
Chen said Taiwan wants independence, a new constitution,
development and a change of its official name, and that 'Taiwan'
is the best name for the country to use in its bid to join the
United Nations and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, there is no such problem as left and right in the path
of development but there is only the problem of independence and
reunification," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
This so-called "four wants and one without" statement immediately
drew broadside from China and Taiwan's pro-unification opposition
parties. They accused Chen of violating the "four noes" pledge he
made in his 2000 inaugural speech, under which Chen promised no
pursuit of formal Taiwan independence nor change of the national
title so long as China doesn't intend to take Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office spokesman said the "fouir wants, one
without" is unrelated to the "four noes" and by no means a
declaration of Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Chen had discussed with his chief and
deputy chief of staff before delivering the "four wants"
statement.
</P>
<P>
"As they believe that the doctrine has not violated any Taiwan
promise to the United States, President Chen didn't bother to
inform the U.S. authorities of any details regarding his speech,
" the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that China has spared no efforts to suppress Taiwan
militarily and diplomatically, the spokesman said the "four
wants, one without" statement serves to remind local people of
China's perennial threat and invite their attention key points of
his administration's Taiwan-centric policy line and stance.
