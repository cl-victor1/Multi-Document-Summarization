Taipei,  March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  20:29:39 (By Flor Wang)

Vice President Annette Lu prioritized the people's livelihoods
Tuesday when outlining her goals to remedy social and economic
ills through a so-called "green co-prosperity concept."
</P>
<P>
Lu proposed the "green co-prosperity concept" at a spring
gathering with representatives from six major trade and business
associations that took place following her registration earlier
the same day for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
primary to vie for its nomination to run in the 2008 presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the "green co-prosperity concept" that she
promotes is focused on production, eco-systems as well as life
quality and meaningfulness, and would be an appropriate remedy
for a capable government to apply in caring for the people's
needs, particularly at a time when Taiwan is facing growing
problems, such as the digital divide, an aging population, new
immigrants, dwindling social security, capital flight and
industrial hollowing out.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwanese society has been hard hit by major blows on the
climatic, social, economic, political and moral fronts," Lu said
when announcing her presidential bid earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
The government, business and industrial communities must realize
that it is extremely important to preserve nature and eco-systems
when pursuing economic development, Lu said, adding that the
people will be able to lead a better life only when natural
environments are well tended.
</P>
<P>
Lu was the first of the DPP's "big four" to register her
candidacy for the party's presidential primary. The other three
bigwigs -- former Premier and former Kaohsuing Mayor Frank Hsieh,
incumbent Premier Su Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun --
are slated to register for the DPP primary March 8.
