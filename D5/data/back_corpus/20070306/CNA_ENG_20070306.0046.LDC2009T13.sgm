Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that he is
not clear on what President Chen Shui-bian really meant by saying
that Taiwan wants independence, because the Republic of China on
Taiwan is already an independent country.

Wang make the remarks when asked to comment on Chen's statement
two days ago, claiming that "Taiwan wants independence, wants
name rectification, wants a new Constitution, and wants
development."
</P>
<P>
Chen was addressing members of the Formosan Association for
Public Affairs at a dinner when he made the statement. He also
said that "Taiwan faces no such problem as to leftist or rightist
policy lines and the only problem for Taiwan concerns national
identity and whether  to unify with China  or to secure Taiwan's
formal independence.
</P>
<P>
The president explained Tuesday that by saying that Taiwan wants
independence, he meant that Taiwan is a sovereign country that is
independent of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The legislative speaker said he is still unclear about the
president's definition of independence.
</P>
<P>
"I need to go home and do some further research about what the
president really means," he said.
