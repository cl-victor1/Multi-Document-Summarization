National Taiwan University professor Hwang Kwang-kuo said Tuesday
that he is poised to take part in the Kuomintang's (KMT) primary
to vie for the party's nomination for the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, Hwang, a liberal
academic, said that he has applied to the KMT to reinstate his
party membership so as to satisfy party regulations stating that
only those who have been members for more than four months are
entitled to participate in its presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Hwang also pledged to seek the endorsements of over 60,000 KMT
members to buttress his presidential candidacy bid as he has not
served at any post within the party.
</P>
<P>
Hwang admitted that he has contacted former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou's camp to discuss major national issues, but denied a media
report that Ma's aides were trying to push him to take part in
the KMT's presidential primary as a means of mitigating pressure
on Ma to form a ticket with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng for the 2008 presidential race without competing in the
party's primary.
</P>
<P>
It was widely reported that Ma and Wang have come under strong
pressure from the KMT to pair up in the next presidential
election if no third aspirants came forward to contend for the
primary, slated for April.
