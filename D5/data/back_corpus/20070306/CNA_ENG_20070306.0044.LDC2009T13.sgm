GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS CONFINING YENSHUI BEEHIVE FIREWORKS LAUNCH

The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) is considering
taking measures to restrain "highly polluted" folk activities
like the Yenshui Fireworks Festival in Tainan County, southern
Taiwan, an EPA official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The issue arose after one of the festive activities caused the
worst recorded instance of air pollution in Taiwan's history,
Chou Shu-yuan, the official in charge of air quality protection
explained, referring to the event in Yenshui March 4, where
millions of so-called beehive fireworks were ignited as part of
Lantern Festival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The climax of the fireworks display occurred when a string of
firecrackers 13 kilometers long -- a new world's record -- was
ignited. However, as a result of the display, the small town was
inundated by heavy mist and the air above Yenshui was found to
contain a high concentration of sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
According to air pollution data collected by EPA researchers the
night of the fireworks in Yenshui, the sulfur dioxide
concentration peaked at 42.4 ppb at a monitoring station in
Yenshui Elementary School near the launch site: a level 21 times
greater than the level detected two days ago at the same spot.
</P>
<P>
At nearing Yenshui Junior High School, the concentration of the
toxic gas was recorded 12 ppb, far higher than the level of 2 ppb
detected two days before the festival kicked off.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the amount of particles -- the air pollutant that most
commonly affects people's health -- was showed a massive increase
from the average normal level of 120 micrograms per square meter
to 429, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
The EPA's proposal to interrupt the fireworks display, however,
triggered strong protests from Yenshui town residents.
</P>
<P>
Yenshui town administrator Yen Chin-shih said the folk activity
has been observed for some 200 years. It is not right for the EPA
to get rid of the fireworks festival, which is essential to local
people as they all believe the more firecrackers they ignite the
more prosperous they will be. Also voicing their opposition, some
town residents threatened to ignite masses of beehive
firecrackers in front of the EPA headquarters if the
administration insists to limiting the festival.
