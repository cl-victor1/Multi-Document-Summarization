PRESIDENT'S LATEST REMARKS IN LINE WITH EARLIER PLEDGES: MAC
CHIEF

Taipei,  March 6 (CNA) 03/06/07  14:30:50 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's latest remarks on Taiwan's sovereignty
do not run counter to his earlier pledges, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu was referring to President Chen's remarks Sunday to a pro-
independence group that Taiwan must seek independence, must
rectify its name, must craft a new constitution and must seek
further development.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the president's remarks are not in conflict with his
"four noes" pledge made in his 2000 inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that the president is actually advocating the maintenance
of the status quo and that the remarks run parallel to his "four
noes" pledge.
</P>
<P>
The "four noes" pledge refers to the president's promise that as
long as China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he
will not declare independence, not change Taiwan's official name,
not include the state-to-state theory on cross-strait relations
into the Constitution and not hold a referendum on the
independence versus unification issue.
</P>
<P>
The president's latest remarks, Wu continued, mean that "we want
to defend the present status quo of Taiwan's independence from
China, we want a timely, relevant and viable constitution, and we
want to let the international community know our name is Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
On whether  the president's  latest  remarks  will  affect cross-
strait relations, Wu said that he doesn't see them having any
impact. The Chinese government's response to Chen's remarks has
been "all right so far," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that He Shizhong, director of the Economic Bureau under
the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, is currently
visiting Taiwan. Given that his itinerary in Taiwan has not
changed, one can see that the president's latest remarks have not
affected the policy of Taiwan's government, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The government has always set peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait as the top goal of its cross-strait policy," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to promote cross-strait exchanges,
with a full opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists and talks on
cross-strait charter flights as the top priority," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged the Taiwan people to have more confidence in themselves
in cross-trait disputes as the status quo is that Taiwan and
China are independent of each other.
</P>
<P>
The president's remark that Taiwan must seek independence means
that Taiwan has to defend its current status quo of independence
from China, Wu said, adding that China's advocacy of
"unification" is in fact an attempt to change the status quo.
