CURCUMINOID FOUND EFFECTIVE AGAINST MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

A newly-developed curcumin compound has proven effective against
muscular dystrophy in tests on rodents, conducted by a U.S.-based
research team led by a Taiwanese professor, sources at Taipei
Medical University (TMU) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
TMU visiting professor and project manager Chang Chawn-shang --
who is also a professor at the University of Rochester, New York
-- has led the experiment since 2002, testing the curcuminoid --
dubbed as "ASC- J9" -- on some 60 rodents with muscular
dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang Yu-chia -- a TMU research fellow and part of
the team, they started with the goal of find a cure for prostate
cancer by breaking down excessive androgen receptors. "However, "
Chang said, "we ended up with findings that showed ASC-J9 can
cure muscular dystrophy related to androgen receptor mutations."
</P>
<P>
In the experiment, the physically-impaired mice regained partial
control over body movement after being given ASC-J9.
</P>
<P>
"If the mice received treatment in the first eight to 10 weeks of
incidence, " they noted, "there was a great chance that their
muscle strength and moving abilities would return to normal
status."
</P>
<P>
They explained that although ASC-J9 cannot prevent onset of the
disease, the treatment was proved effective in prolonging the
lifespan of the mice involved, from an average life expectancy of
29 to 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The medication's second stage of human testing will begin in the
following months, Chang pointed out, adding that if everything
goes well, ASC-J9 could become the first medicine available
capable of curing human muscular dystrophy.
