FUJI TV ACCUSES GIO OF INTERVENING IN TTV SHARES SALE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  March 26 (CNA) 03/26/07  12:39:39 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
An official of Japan's Fuji Television Network accused Taiwan's
government Sunday of trying to intervene in the company's sale of
its holding in the Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV).
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Lai Kuo-chou, the recently replaced chairman of
the state- controlled TTV, Sumio Hasegawa, assistant to Fuji TV's
chairman,  held a news conference in Taipei and claimed that
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tsang and
Minister of Economic Affairs Steven Chen in a Jan. 17 lunch
meeting had attempted to persuade Fuji TV to sell its TTV shares
to Taiwan's Liberty Times Group because the group is close to the
government.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a scandal had it happened in Japan," Hasegawa said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, however, denied Hasegawa's claim, saying the GIO respects
Fuji TV's decision.
</P>
<P>
Fuji TV in 1962 acquired five-percent stake in TTV, but in
November 2006, the National Communications Commission (NCC)
decided that foreign companies should release their share
holdings in Taiwan's terrestrial TV stations.
</P>
<P>
According to Hasegawa, Cheng in December offered to visit Fuji TV
President Hisashi Hieda but due to the failure to set up a time
convenient for both sides, the GIO asked Fuji TV to send
delegates to Taiwan for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa said that after a short meeting at Cheng's office on
Jan. 16, he and one Fuji TV official in charge of share holdings
were invited by Cheng to attend a lunch the next day, which was
also attended by Steve Chen, Liberty Times Chairman Wu Ah-ming,
as well as its president, Andy Lin, and vice editor-in- chief,
Tzou Jiing-wen.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa mentioned that he was surprised to hear, through an
interpreter, Cheng say during the lunch that "it is up to Fuji TV
to whom it sells its TTV shares, but we recommend that you sell
them to the Liberty Times." He said Cheng added that the request
was not an exercise of pressure on Fuji TV.
</P>
<P>
Chen was also quoted by Hasegawa as saying that the government
has expressed the same wish to two other Japanese companies that
hold TTV shares and hopes Fuji TV will act in line with this
wish.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa  pointed out that he instantly  rejected the two
ministers' request, saying the sale of shares is purely a
commercial matter, and not one in which the government should
intervene.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa claimed that Cheng responded to his doubts about the
government's intention by saying that "to the ruling party, the
Liberty Times is the most trustworthy media organization, " that
"it would be the best choice to have the Liberty Times control
TTV."
</P>
<P>
However, Hasegawa said, Wu, who sat to his left, told him in
fluent Japanese that "I did not know this is such an occasion, I
feel ashamed and sorry, and I beg your pardon."
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa said Lin hardly uttered a word while Tzou told him that
Lee Teng-hui, former president of Taiwan, would be glad if Fuji
TV were to sell the shares to Liberty Times.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa said he held the Sunday news conference in order to
reveal the truth and protect his company.
</P>
<P>
"I was a journalist for more than 30 years, having been stationed
in Washington, Bangkok and Seoul, but this was the first time in
my life to see such government lobbying," Hasegawa said.
</P>
<P>
Tzou said Sunday that the Liberty Times did not offer to buy Fuji
TV's TTV shares, adding that the lunch with Fuji officials was
only meant to enhance relations between the media organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chen could not be reached for comment that day.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa said Fuji TV later sold the shares to Lai Kuo-chou, "not
out of any disaffection toward the GIO but because of
longstanding trust and shared perspectives with Lai."
</P>
<P>
Lai, who previously served as the chairman of the TTV for seven
years, was replaced last week due to his purchase of TTV shares
from the company's Japanese investors.
