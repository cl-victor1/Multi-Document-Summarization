A top hotel manager urged the government Monday to help avoid
land speculation by domestic traders if the country is serious
about wanting to attract leading tourist hotels from around the
world to invest here.
</P>

Stanley Yen, president of the Ritz Landis Taipei hotel who was
instrumental in arranging for a visit to eastern Taiwan recently
by the management of the top- flight Burj Al Arab Hotel, said
that if the government  is keen to develop scenic eastern Taiwan
into a world-class tourism paradise, it should come up with a
comprehensive development plan that will preserve the natural
beauty of the area, provide enough areas for foreign investors to
develop and prevent land speculation.

Yen -- an emeritus chairman of the Taiwan Visitors' Association
who is known for having successfully rejuvenated the Grand Hotel,
which used to be the jewel in the crown of Taiwan's tourist
hotels before falling into mediocrity -- recently invited Alwin
Zecha, the younger brother of the owner of the seven-star Burj Al
Arab Hotel and two-term chairman of the Pacific Asia Travel
Association, to visit the eastern county of Taitung.

News reports have said that the hotelier from Dubai is initially
interested  in turning a Taitung hotspring  hotel into a new
attraction, taking advantage of the natural beauty and white sand
of the quiet city by the Pacific Ocean.

<P>
The management of the Dubai hotel will be scared away if land
speculation starts long before the hotel even begins to develop
the Taitung location, Yen warned.
