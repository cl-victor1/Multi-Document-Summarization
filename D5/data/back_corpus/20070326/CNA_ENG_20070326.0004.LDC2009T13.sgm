Taipei, March 25 (CNA) 03/26/07  11:41:11 (By Maubo Chang)

Hong Kong's unfriendly attitude toward Taiwan has negatively
impacted bilateral ties, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Sunday amid a dispute over Hong Kong's denial of entry to a MAC
official.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the MAC rebutted a Hong Kong official's claim
that Hong Kong denied MAC commissioner Chang Chih-yu entry
because his working visa expired last July.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said that although Chang's working visa expired last
July, he holds a multiple-entry visa valid until May of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the MAC said, Chang had asked Hong Kong immigration
officials about his trip before his departure for the special
administrative region March 23 and was given a positive answer,
although he was cautioned against engaging in certain activities
during his stay.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the press release said, Chang, following a Hong Kong
immigration official's suggestion, applied for an electronic visa
at the airport upon his arrival after being told that his working
visa had expired. However, Chang's application was rejected by
Hong Kong authorities for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said Chang and another MAC official, Huang Chien-liang,
were to accompany a group of Taiwan journalists to Hong Kong to
cover the March 25 election of Hong Kong's chief executive.
Huang's application for a visa was turned down only hours before
his scheduled departure, and Chang was turned back upon his
arrival in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong authorities' flip-flop on the matter has exposed its
unfriendliness toward Taiwan, which has negatively impacted
bilateral ties," the MAC said.
