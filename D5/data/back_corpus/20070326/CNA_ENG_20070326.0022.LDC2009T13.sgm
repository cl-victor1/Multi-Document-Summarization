<P>
The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has decided to give a
facelift to the first terminal of the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, CAA officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that the CAA will have to spend NT$1.4
billion (US$42.42 million) over a three-year-and-half period for
the renovation work.
</P>
<P>
After  the proposal  is approved  by the Executive  Yuan,
construction work can start within 15 months, the officials
added.
</P>
<P>
They said that the construction will be conducted at night as
much as possible to mitigate the impact on the operations of the
terminal, adding that the first terminal has been in use for
nearly three decades and is showing signs of aging both inside
and out.
</P>
<P>
The facelift will be part of efforts to improve the image of the
airport, which is Taiwan's main gateway to the world.
</P>
<P>
Japanese architect Norihiko Dan, who is commissioned to design
the facelift, has completed an initial design. He will adopt a
partial overhaul that will not affect the main structure of the
terminal, they said.
</P>
<P>
Dan will attempt to give it a new look with the use of curtains
designed to enhance the brightness of the terminal and make the
terminal look magnificent at night with the reflection of the
light.
