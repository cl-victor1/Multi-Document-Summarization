A newspaper distributed free on Taipei's MRT system began
publication Monday, with copies available from 300 stands at 69
MRT stations in Taipei city and county, a spokesman for the
Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Taipei County Magistrate Chou
Hsi-wei attended the launch ceremony for Upaper, which is billed
as providing lifestyle information for MRT passengers.
</P>
<P>
Hau and Chou both expressed hope that Upaper will enrich
passengers' lives, but they also reminded passengers to recycle
Upaper after reading it to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
The paper, with a daily print run of 180,000 issues, is designed
to target students and salaried people aged 16-35, particularly
women, the spokesman said.

TRTC is holding a nine-day "dress code party" from March 25-30
and from April 2-4 to promote the paper. Passengers who dress
according to a prescribed dress code when traveling on the MRT
and who agree to be photographed by a TRTC photographer will have
the chance of appearing on the cover of Upaper and winning an
EasyCard pass allowing MRT travel worth NT$12,000 (US$360) for a
maximum of 80 days.
