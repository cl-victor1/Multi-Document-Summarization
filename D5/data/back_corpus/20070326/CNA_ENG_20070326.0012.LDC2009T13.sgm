Legislators from across the political spectrum locked horns
Monday when reviewing a draft bill on absentee voting proposed by
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Ting Shou-chung.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill proposes that electoral workers; active duty
military personnel and police; students studying outside their
hometowns; prisoners; people who are confined to their homes or
hospital due to illness or physical disability; and people
working outside the area where they are registered be allowed to
cast absentee ballots in major elections.
</P>
<P>
Opposing Ting's draft bill, ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Legislator Chen Chin-der claimed that by trying to include
people working outside the areas where they are registered on the
absentee voters list, the KMT is scheming to solicit the support
of ROC citizens maintaining business operations in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsin-nan, whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said he will
"fight to the end" against the draft bill.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the DPP lawmakers' remarks, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-
sheng said that if Ting's version is unacceptable to the ruling
party legislators, the draft bill can be adopted in a "two-stage"
approach -- namely allowing electoral workers; active duty
military personnel and police; students studying outside their
hometowns; prisoners; and people confined to their homes or
hospital to cast absentee ballots in the first stage, and then
including the last category of people in the second stage of the
bill's enactment.
</P>
<P>
Huang Shih-cho, a legislator from opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union, an ally of the ruling DPP, said Wu's "two-stage" proposal
is equally unacceptable.  Huang said ROC voters working overseas,
including in China, should never be included in the absentee
voter name list so as to "nix the possibility of Chinese
interference in Taiwan's elections."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during her report at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan
Foreign Affairs Committee, Chang Fu-mei, minister of the Overseas
Compatriot Affairs Commission, said that if the lawmakers intend
to pass an absentee voting bill into a law, an amendment to the
ROC Constitution is first required.
</P>
<P>
According to an additional article to the Constitution, Chang
said, Taiwanese expatriots intending to vote in a presidential
election must return to Taiwan to cast the ballots.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there were some 1 million ROC voters residing
overseas in 2004, with about 10,000 of them returning to Taiwan
to cast ballots in the presidential election that year, Chang
said she does not think that the absentee voting bill will be
passed into law before the March presidential election in 2008.
