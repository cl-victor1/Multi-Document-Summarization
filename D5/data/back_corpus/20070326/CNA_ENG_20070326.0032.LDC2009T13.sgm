President Chen Shui-bian should clear his schedule and
concentrate on handling the crisis over a serious split within
the DPP, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus urged Monday.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Wang Hsing-nan told a press conference at the
Legislative Yuan that there is a serious split within the DPP
because of an ongoing dispute over who is to blame for a decision
that forced the president to announce late last year that he
would resign if a lower court trial finds the first lady guilty
of corruption and forgery in an embezzlement case involving her
alleged misuse of the president's state affairs fund.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the president should summon DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
and Premier Su Tseng-chang -- the main figures involved in the
dispute -- to the Presidential Office in order to clarify the
issue and lay it to rest once for all.
</P>
<P>
Wang also urged all members of the DPP caucus not to make any
further comment nor to put forward new theories regarding who is
responsible for compelling the president to pledge Nov. 5 that he
would resign if the first lady is found guilty of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Yeh Yi-chin, general secretary of the DPP legislative
caucus, recalled that she had attended numerous caucus meetings
last last year to discuss how to cope with a looming leadership
crisis for the DPP, but had never heard anyone proposing that the
president should step down if the lower court passes a guilty
verdict on the first lady.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said Yu, Su and the other two presidential hopefuls -- Vice
President Annette Lu and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- should
have the wisdom to see that a united DPP will have a better
chance to win the presidential election in 2008.
