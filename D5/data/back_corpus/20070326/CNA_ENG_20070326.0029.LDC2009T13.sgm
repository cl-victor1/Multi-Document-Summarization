DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS URGED NOT TO ACCUSE EACH OTHER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 26 (CNA) 03/26/07  19:44:31 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) heavyweights  who
are seeking the party's nomination to represent the DPP in the
2008 presidential election should stop pointing the finger of
blame at one another, a former DPP legislator said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Fu-hsiung, an outspoken veteran DPP politician, said in a
news release that it was "unkind" for the presidential hopefuls
to pin the blame on each other for the decision to have President
Chen Shui-bian announce Nov. 5 last year that he will resign if a
lower court trial finds his wife guilty of corruption in an
embezzlement case involving her alleged misuse of the president's
state affairs fund for his discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
The president's announcement came two days after a public
prosecutor filed an indictment with the Taipei District Court,
charging the first lady, Wu Shu-jen, with corruption and forgery
and naming her and the president as "joint perpetrators"  in the
embezzlement case.
</P>
<P>
Shen said DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, Premier Su Tseng-chang and
former Premier Frank Hsieh were "anxiously trying to demonstrate
their loyalty to the president" during a debate in front of a
radical faction championing Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
The three DPP political heavyweights tried so hard to put
themselves in a favorable light in terms of their crisis-handling
ability that they lost the "magnanimity and grandeur" they should
have displayed in reviewing the past, according to Shen.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that many DPP members feel that the president made too
great a concession in agreeing to step down should the lower
court pass a guilty verdict on the first lady, and said this
probably contributed to the present move within the DPP to find
whoever it was that persuaded the president to make that
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Shen claimed that the idea of asking the president to make the
announcement was generated through group brainstorming within the
DPP and added that those who proposed the idea, discussed it and
took part in the joint decision all deserve credit.
</P>
<P>
"We now seem to have forgotten that the president's announcement
effectively dissolved pressure from the tens of thousands of
protesters to depose him and ended threats by the opposition
Kuomintang to introduce a motion to recall him," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Shen concluded in the news release that anyone pointing the
finger of blame at others when difficult times are over would be
"too unkind," with the possible outcome that DPP members will not
dare to speak their minds freely the next time another difficult
issue arises.
</P>
<P>
The president's initial efforts to select the DPP's presidential
and vice presidential nominees through his mediation appear to
have failed and DPP members are scheduled to vote in a party
primary May 6, followed by a series of public opinion polls to
select the presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Party members' votes will account for 30 percent of each
candidate's score, with the remaining 70 percent determined by
his or her approval ratings in the opinion polls. The final
result will be announced May 30.
