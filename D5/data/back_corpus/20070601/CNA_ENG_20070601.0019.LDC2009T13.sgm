New Premier Chang Chun-hsiung pledged Friday to aggressively work
to create a clean and safe election environment ahead of two
major elections -- the year-end legislative election and the
presidential election in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who assumed office May 21, said he believes that "cracking
down on money politics" and "eradicating vote-buying" are what
the people expect a clean government to do.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the pledge while delivering an administrative policy
report at the Legislative Yuan. In the report, he reiterated that
"replacing conflict with cooperation" and "building nests instead
of walls" are the fundamental guiding principles of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
It is the ongoing conflict between the ruling and opposition
parties that has blocked the central government's 2007 general
budget bill from clearing the Legislative Yuan, slowed down the
nation's economic growth, and brought about a rise in
unemployment, Chang said. In a humble and sincere manner, the
premier asked the Legislative Yuan to pass the budget bill as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the economy, Chang said that the Executive Yuan will
continue promoting financial reform while making efforts to carry
out his "Taiwan Priority" policy aimed at encouraging overseas
Taiwanese business people to invest in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Besides working to make Taiwan more prosperous, Chang said his
administration will also continue to work on implementing the
series of "Mega Warmth"  social welfare  programs  initiated  by
his predecessor, Su Tseng-chang, and will do its utmost to
resolve problems related to the development of small and medium
enterprises, economic development in the less-developed central
and southern Taiwan regions, and the livelihood of the lower
class.
</P>
<P>
On the topic of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the premier said
Taiwan should display its determination in defending its
sovereignty, adding that to this end, the government should
actively work to push for military reforms and carry out military
arms procurement projects while  bidding  for  the country's
entry into  international organizations, including the United
Nations, under the name of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the upcoming 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Chang said
Taiwan sincerely hopes that the international sporting festival
which is widely seen as a symbol of "peace" and "friendship" will
help the two sides of the strait resume dialogue.
