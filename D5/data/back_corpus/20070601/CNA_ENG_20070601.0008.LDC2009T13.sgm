President Chen Shui-bian met with Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed
Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud late Thursday and decorated the
visiting Arabian "king of business" with one of the highest
honors bestowed by the Republic of China government.
</P>
<P>
Chen conferred the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand
Cordon on Alwaleed in a ceremony held at the Presidential Office
in recognition of Alwaleed's contributions  to cementing
bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Chen lauded Alwaleed as not only a shrewd financial player, whose
global investments include a large stake in the Citibank Group,
but also a hardworking manager who often spends more than 18
hours a day shuttling among four countries for business
rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
The president told the major shareholder of Citibank -- one of
the largest full service banks in the world -- that the Citigroup
Taiwan's transactions exceed US$100 million a year, making it the
leading foreign bank operating in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen  also  offered  congratulations  to Alwaleed  for the
construction of the soon to be inaugurated Four Seasons Hotel in
Taipei, in which Alwaleed's business group has invested.
</P>
<P>
The president added that total foreign investment in Taiwan has
exceeded US$70 billion and that the amount of foreign capital in
Taiwan's bourse has surpassed US$120 billion.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabian prince arrived in Taipei late Thursday for a
brief visit on the fourth leg of his whirlwind Asian business
tour, which has also taken him to Brunei, Vietnam and Malaysia.
