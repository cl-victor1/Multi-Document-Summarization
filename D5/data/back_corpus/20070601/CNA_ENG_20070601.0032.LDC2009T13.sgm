Taipei,  June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  21:01:34 (By Lilian Wu)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate
Frank Hsieh said Friday that he is not in a hurry to pick his
running mate for the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh made the remarks on the sidelines of an activity organized
the Taipei- based Chinese Institute of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not want to decide on who to pair up with so
early, adding that "I will have to see the development of the
political situation as well as other matters before making a
decision."
</P>
<P>
On President Chen Shui-bian's instruction earlier that day to
upgrade Taichung City to that of a special municipality like
Taipei and Kaohsiung, he said he is not opposed to the upgrade,
although Taiwan should have "longer-term planning."
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan should be divided into six provinces or states,
each of about 4 million people, which he claimed would be "most
favorable to international competition."
</P>
<P>
It could also avoid the disputes over which cities get to be
promoted to the level of a special municipality and which cities
do not.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier remarks by Hsieh, Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung
County and Pingtung County can be integrated into one province;
Yunlin County, Chiayi County and Tainan County can form the
second province; Taichung County, Changhua County, Nantou County
the third province; Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County and Miaoli
County the fourth province; Taipei County, Keelung City and Yilan
County the fifth province; and a special administration can
encompass Hualien County and Taitung County.
