The General Headquarters of the Army said in a press release that
an investigation conducted Friday by a ten-member investigation
panel led by Maj. Gen. Chen Liang-pei, president of the Republic
of China Military Academy (ROCMA), found that the U.S. cadet
neither raped the woman nor forced her to have sex with him. The
woman who was present at the investigation didn't take exception
to the panel's finding, according to the press release.

<P>
According to Wednesday's United Daily News, the cadet from West
Point who is in the ROCMA on an exchange program was accused by a
local woman of having sex with her without her consent.
</P>
<P>
The woman told the paper that she was introduced to the West
Point cadet in a pub in Tainan City last Friday night by a friend
studying at the ROCMA, identified by his surname as Chuang, who
was in charge of receiving the West Point cadet during his stay
in Taiwan for a short-term exchange program at the ROCMA.

<P>
The woman claimed that Chuang and the West Point cadet kept
encouraging her to drink and that they brought her out of the pub
soon after midnight, when she had become "half drunk" after
consuming about three bottles of beer.
</P>
<P>
Chuang then left her with the West Point cadet, who later brought
her to the city's Evergreen Laurel Hotel, the woman said.
</P>
<P>
As they entered the hotel room, the cadet began stripping off her
clothes, the woman claimed, adding that he then engaged in sexual
intercourse with her before she "even had a chance to resist" as
she was not fully conscious due to the effects of the alcohol she
had consumed, according to the report.
