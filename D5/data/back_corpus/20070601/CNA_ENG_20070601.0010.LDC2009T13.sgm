Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, who has been hospitalized for more than
a month since suffering a minor stroke Apr. 26, is expected to be
discharged from hospital next week to allow her to return to
work, Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san said Friday.

<P>
Chiu said the mayor has been recovering well, spending most of
her time exercising, including riding a stationary exercise bike
and climbing staircases, in order to strengthen her muscles.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, Chen's doctors at the Kaohsiung Medical
University Hospital, where Chen has been recuperating and
undergoing rehabilitation, have asked the mayor to lose some
weight as "the essential means" to tackle her problems of chronic
high blood pressure and heart disease, which were the main causes
of her minor stroke.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that Chen has asked to be discharged from the hospital
and that her doctors are assessing the feasibility of granting
her request.
