CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS KEY TO PRESIDENT'S LEGACY: GROUP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 1 (CNA) 06/01/07  19:47:04 (By Lilian Wu)

Whether President Chen Shui-bian can deliver on his pledges
regarding constitutional reforms in the last year of his
presidency will be a test of what his legacy will be, a civic
group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Association of University Professors made the remarks
during a news conference to unveil a mid-term report on Taiwan's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the public is "generally positive" about
Chen's performance in the areas of strengthening Taiwan-centric
consciousness and promoting a pluralistic democracy and financial
reforms.
</P>
<P>
But  in the areas  of constitutional  reforms,  ecological
preservation and the realization of social fairness and justice,
the president has yet to meet expectations, the report says,
adding that whether he can realize those goals in the last year
of his presidency will affect his legacy.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chu-feng, a lecturer at National Chi Nan University, said
that compared with the turbulent street protests by the "red-
clad" protesters last year to demand that Chen to step down in
the wake of a series of corruption scandals surrounding his
family members and top aides, this year seems to be calmer.
</P>
<P>
"But the ideological rivalry is even fiercer, " he said, adding
that the ruling and the opposition parties have continued their
ethnic mobilization with winning the presidential election next
year as their major concerns.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's relations with China, National Taiwan University
Professor Chen Chun-sheng said the opposition Kuomintang and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) has held cross-Taiwan Strait trade
forums, agricultural cooperation forums and trade and cultural
forums since 2005.
</P>
<P>
Chen said this is China's attempt to join forces with Taiwan's
private sector to drive a wedge between the Taiwan government and
its people.
</P>
<P>
China's two-pronged approach -- courting Taiwan's private sector
on one hand and bashing Taiwan relentlessly internationally --
will only antagonize the Taiwan people, according to the
professor.
