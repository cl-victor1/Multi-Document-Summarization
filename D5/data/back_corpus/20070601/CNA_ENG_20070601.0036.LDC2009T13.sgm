A visiting British education official said Friday that he was
impressed by the high levels of performance of Taiwanese students
and encouraged more Taiwanese students to go to U.K. to pursue
higher education.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese  students can attain high levels of performance,
particularly in mathematics and science subjects, said Andrew
Adonis, U.K. Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Schools.
</P>
<P>
Adonis was speaking during a private visit to Taipei to look at
the strengths of the Taiwanese education system, in particular
the factors that explain the sustained high attainment of
Taiwanese children in standard international tests.
</P>
<P>
The schools he visited -- Jianguo Senior High School and Renai
Junior High School -- have seen substantial increases in
creativity education in their curricula, as well as self-directed
learning and life skills learning, Adonis said, adding that this
is something the U.K. education system can learn from.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke at National Chengchi University about the U.K.
experience of education reform, noting that there are moves to
give schools greater autonomy in school management and to give
parents greater choice in terms of the types of schools on offer.
</P>
<P>
The U.K. government has placed "great emphasis on education"
since Prime Minister Tony Blair assumed office 10 years ago, he
claimed. One of the key priorities in U.K. education reform has
been to "get the right leadership and teachers in schools, "
Adonis said.
</P>
<P>
Among the practical measures taken are increasing teachers'
salaries by 20 percent and those of principals by 25 percent, he
said. Currently there are 40,000 more teachers than there were 10
years ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
In terms of higher education, the U.K. government is seeking to
expand the numbers of universities and work-related degree
courses and to increase funding and investment on leading-edge
science.
</P>
<P>
Adonis visited Hong Kong and Singapore prior to his arrival in
Taiwan. On Saturday he is scheduled to discuss aspects of
Taiwan's education reform with academics and experts.
