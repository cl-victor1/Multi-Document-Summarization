STALEMATE OVER ELECTION COMMISSION REMAINS

Taipei, March 7 (CNA) 03/08/07  10:57:49 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
Inter-party negotiations in the legislature over the composition
of the Central Election Commission failed Wednesday and caucus
leaders expect a Thursday showdown over the same issue that in
January led to fights and a blockage of the central government's
annual budget bill.
</P>
<P>
There will be no solution if the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
insists on its unconstitutional articles,said Ker Chien-ming, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) caucus leader.
</P>
<P>
Ker's counterpart in the KMT, Hsu Shao-ping, meanwhile, said the
bill of the Organic Act of the Central Election Commission should
be subjected  to a plenary vote Thursday afternoon  if prolonged
negotiations again fail that morning.
</P>
<P>
According to the KMT's revised proposal, the 17-seat Central
Election Commission should be made up by members recommended by
political parties in proportion to their legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The parties could, largely independent of one another, recommend
a total of 34 candidates from which the premier would choose half
of each party's candidates and then send the list of names back
to the legislature for approval before formal nomination, the
proposal said.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, legislative caucuses could jointly arrive at a
34-name list through negotiations, from which the premier would
then choose half after consulting with the speaker of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The KMT still insists on putting the election commission bill
before the general budget bill on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Ker said KMT's proposal represents a violation of executive power
by the legislature and is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, however, called on the DPP not to filibuster, or take
responsibility for the failure of the central government's annual
budget bill. ENDITME/jnc
