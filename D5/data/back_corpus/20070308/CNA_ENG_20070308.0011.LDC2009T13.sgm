Japan's Niwano Peace Foundation has decided to award its 24th
Niwano Peace Prize to Taiwan's Dharma Master Cheng Yen, founder
of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, in
recognition of her contribution to serving people in need, a Tzu
Chi spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Yen is the first Taiwanese recipient of the Niwano Peace
Prize since the prize was established 24 years ago to honor
individuals and organizations that have contributed significantly
to inter-religious cooperation, thereby furthering the cause of
world peace, and to make their achievements known as widely as
possible.

<P>
Wang Tuan-cheng,  deputy  chief executive  of the Tzu Chi
Foundation, said the Niwano Peace Foundation already held news
conferences in Britain, Switzerland, the Vatican and Japan Feb.
27 to announce its decision to award its 2007 peace prize to
Master Cheng Yen.

The presentation ceremony will be held in Tokyo May 10. In
addition to an award certificate, the winner will also receive a
medal and 20 million yen (US$171,451) in prize money.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the Niwano foundation president is scheduled
to visit the Tzu chi Foundation headquarters in eastern Hualien
County in May before the presentation ceremony.

Cheng Yen was quoted as having said that she will share the award
with the large army of Tzu Chi volunteers scattered around the
globe to express her heartfelt gratitude for their long-term
support and assistance in carrying out her three vows to "purify
minds, harmonize society and free the world from disasters."
</P>
<P>
The venerable nun founded Tzu Chi in 1966, with "instructing the
rich and saving the poor" as its motto in carrying out four great
missions -- in the areas of charity, medicine, education and
culture. Under Cheng Yen's leadership, the Tzu Chi Foundation has
been involved in international disaster relief, bone marrow
donation, environmental protection and community volunteerism.

Cheng Yen was previously awarded the Eisenhower Medallion for her
contribution to world peace and was once nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
The Niwano Peace Foundation was established by the Japanese lay-
Buddhist organization Rissho Kosei-kai in 1978 to contribute to
the realization of world peace and the enhancement of a culture
of peace. It began to present an annual Niwano Peace Prize in
1983. To date, 23 individuals and groups of the Catholic,
Christian, Islamic, Jewish and Buddhist faiths from more than 10
countries have received the prize.
