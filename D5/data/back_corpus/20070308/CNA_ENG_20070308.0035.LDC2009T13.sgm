Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
said Thursday that his decision to vie for the party's nomination
for the 2008 presidential election is aimed at achieving the
historic mission of transforming Taiwan into a normal country
during the post-Chen Shui-bian era.
</P>
<P>
Yu, who registered his candidacy for the DPP's presidential
primary  Thursday morning,  made the remarks while issuing a
declaration to his supporters to expound on his determination to
participate in the presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that former President Lee Teng-hui's mission during his
12-year term was to promote the nation's political
democratization, Yu said President Chen Shui-bian's task was to
consolidate and focus power in Taiwanese hands after coming to
power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yu continued that the mission of the next president, to be
elected in 2008, will be building Taiwan into a normal nation,
which he said is the DPP's historic mission during the post-Chen
era.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the current stalemate  in cross-Taiwan  Strait
relations, Yu admitted that various cross-strait issues have had
an impact on the nation's political and economic development, but
he stressed that if all the people of Taiwan can be steadfast in
the core values of Taiwanese identity, all problems will be
ironed out smoothly
</P>
<P>
"As long as all of us can put national interests before personal
interests and join forces with the government to step up the
nation's normalization, we will be able to build a Republic of
Taiwan with sovereignty, social justice, economic prosperity and
sustainable development", he asserted.
</P>
<P>
Yu, a former premier who also used to be President Chen's chief
of staff, was the second DPP bigwig to register for the party's
presidential primary after Vice President Annette Lu, who
completed her registration Tuesday.

<P>
After completing his registration, Yu also announced that his
future campaign mate will be an outstanding woman.
