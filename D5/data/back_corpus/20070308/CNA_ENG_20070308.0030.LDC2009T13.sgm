KAOHSIUNG MAYOR CALLS FOR GREATER INVESTMENT BY STATE-RUN

Kaohsiung, March 8 (CNA) 03/08/07  19:53:31 (By Flor Wang)

Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu called Thursday for greater investment
by state-run companies in the southern port city so as to "give
back" to its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Chen issued the call during a meeting at the Kaohsiung city
government with a group of 28 foreign reporters stationed in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Urging these foreign journalists to observe carefully the vigor
and pulse of the city and its citizens, Chen opined that state-
owned enterprises should make greater investments in Kaohsiung so
as to help mend a long-term imbalance in development between
Taiwan's southern and northern regions.
</P>
<P>
While keen to retain its traditional labor-intensive businesses,
Kaohsiung is also eager to promote the opto-electronics and
tourism industries in transformational efforts, Chen said in
response to a query from a Voice of America reporter.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Taipei, Kaohsiung still lacks a national theater
and its mass rapid train system is yet to be finalized, Chen said
while answering questions from a BBC reporter.
</P>
<P>
As Kaohsiung is a heavily industrialized city, the municipal
government is determined to plant 1.5 million trees in spare
public spaces to help reduce the city's pollution, she pointed
out.
