PREMIER REGISTERS FOR DPP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  March  8 (CNA) 03/08/07  20:08:18 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang registered his candidacy Thursday
afternoon with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for
the party's 2008 presidential primary election.
</P>
<P>
Su became the last of four DPP bigwigs to register a presidential
bid. DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former premier Frank Hsieh did
so earlier the same day and Vice President Annette Lu two days
before.
</P>
<P>
Su said that Taiwan's transition from authoritarianism  to
democracy represented the fulfillment of the DPP's promise to the
Taiwanese people, and that in the future Taiwan should continue
to pursue the cause of becoming a "normal, complete and beautiful
country."
</P>
<P>
Su declared himself an honest and pragmatic hard-worker who
prefers doing to talking.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Yu and Hsieh who were escorted by large numbers of
supporters to the DPP headquarters, Su was accompanied by his
wife, daughters, a few close aides, and elderly or blind people
when he greeted the country's women for the March 8 Women's Day
and vowed to care for the disadvantaged.
