Taipei,  March 8 (CNA) 03/08/07  20:19:31 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
A Mongolian trade mission comprised of officials and private
business leaders has arrived in Taiwan to solicit Taiwan
investment in Mongolia's infrastructure development as well for a
shopping spree for made-in-Taiwan machinery and goods.
</P>
<P>
The trade mission, led by Sedbazar Otgonbat, vice chairman of
Mongolia's Cabinet-level Foreign Investment and Foreign Trade
Agency, is not only placing orders in Taiwan for mine-exploration
machinery, wooden and steel construction materials and related
hardware, it is also  inviting  Taiwan  investors  to invest  in
Mongolia's infrastructure, including real estate development,
mining and running water plants.
</P>
<P>
Otgonbat  said during a workshop  on Mongolian  investment
opportunities that a US$600 million nationwide urban development
project has just kicked off in Mongolia, under which 10,000
apartment units will be built in the capital city of Ulan Bator,
15,000 housing units will be built in new rural towns around the
country and another 15,000 independent houses will be built to
replace yurts scattered in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwanese builders and businessmen are welcome to cash in on
this phenomenal real estate development project, " Otgonbat said
during the workshop co- sponsored by the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA).
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese investors are also welcome to join the development of
tourist hotels and recreational centers in Mongolia, TAITRA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Mongolia have increasingly
grown since 2002 when Taiwan established its representative
office and a Taiwan trade center in Ulan Bator. In return, Ulan
Bator established a trade and economic office in Taipei in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Mongolian mission is the third of its kind to visit
Taiwan since 2002, but Otgonbat is the highest-ranking Mongolian
official to lead a delegation to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia -- rich in natural resources such as copper, gold and
wool -- scored an overall economic growth of 6.2 percent in 2005,
which grew sharply to 8.4 percent in 2006, mainly as a result of
robust export trade.
</P>
<P>
With natural resources and energy resources becoming increasingly
scarce worldwide, Mongolia has become one of the hottest
investment targets for global investors, TAITRA officials said.
