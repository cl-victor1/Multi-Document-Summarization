Taiwan has the largest foreign presence in the 2007 Panama
International Trade Exhibition that started March 7, with the
opening ceremony presided over by President Martin Torrijos, a
Republic of China Embassy official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Jen-yu, economic counselor to the embassy, a
Taiwanese pavilion with 71 booths has been set up at the annual
trade fair that will run through March 10, followed by Brazil
with 60 booths.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation, comprised of 58 manufacturers, arrived in
Panama March 4 and made a fact-finding visit March 5 to the Colon
Free Trade Zone to gain a better understanding of its operations
concerning transshipment of imported products to other Latin
American states, Huang said.

<P>
He said that during the trade show, the delegation will organize
a trade seminar to expound on bilateral trade developments after
the Taiwan-Panama Free Trade Agreement that came into force Jan.
1, 2004.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, two-way trade between Taiwan
and Panama surpassed US$2 billion in 2006, including
transshipment trade volume through the Colon Free Trade Zone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwanese Ambassador to Panama Hou Ping-fu said after
signing free trade accords with Taiwan, the United States, Chile
and El Salvador that Panama is seeking to ink a similar agreement
with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwanese manufacturers use Panama as a springboard for sales
promotions, they can not only export their products to the
Americas, but will also be able to sell goods to Europe in the
future, according to Hou.
