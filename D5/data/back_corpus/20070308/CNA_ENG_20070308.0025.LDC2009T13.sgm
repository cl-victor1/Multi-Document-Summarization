A local delegation has traveled to Australia to join an
international united protest over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe's denial that comfort women were forced into sexual slavery
during World War II by the Japanese military, a spokeswoman for
the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) said Thursday.

<P>
Accompanied by TWRF representatives, the oldest surviving
Taiwanese comfort woman, 91-year-old, left Taipei for Sydney
Wednesday to join the protest.

The spokeswoman said survivors from three countries joined the
protest, organized by the Australian government, to object to
Abe's March 1 claim that there is "no proof" to show that the
Japanese military coerced Asian women to work as sex slaves, a
claim that has drawn international outrage.

During the protest, Huan, Holland's Jan Ruff O' Herne, 86, and
South Korean Gil Uon Ok, unveiled a joint statement demanding
that the Japanese government address issues left over after World
War II as soon as possible.

<P>
An Australian history teacher and a Green Party councillor joined
the protest on Martin Place in front of the Japanese Embassy in
Sydney to support the survivors, with the councillor promising to
ask the Australian government to pressure the Japanese government
on the issues.
</P>
<P>
The TWRF spokeswoman pointed out that U.S. Congressman Mike Honda
submitted a resolution to the U.S. Congress Jan. 31 that asks the
Japanese government to apologize formally for the sex slaves and
to invite survivors to offer testimony in Congress. Abe's denial
reflects Japanese government's concern about the resolution,
according to the representative.
