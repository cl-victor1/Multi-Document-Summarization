Taipei, March 8 (CNA) 03/08/07  17:14:01 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taipei prosecutors Thursday sought a prison sentence of 30 years
and an unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million)
for fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up their investigation into the high-profile scandal
involving  Wang's Rebar  Asia Pacific  Group and the alleged
embezzlement of billions of dollars by Wang and his wife from
Rebar assets that left a number of Rebar Group companies
bankrupt, the prosecutors also indicted 106 other people involved
in the scandal on charges of forgery, fraud, insider trading and
other irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors are also seeking a prison term of 28 years and a
fine to the tune of NT$710 million for Wang's wife, Wang Chin
She-ying.
</P>
<P>
Two of Wang's sons -- Wang Ling-yi and Wang Ling-tai -- also face
28 years in jail, while Wang Shih-chan, a younger brother of
Wang, faces 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Four other members of the Wang family also face prison terms
ranging from six years to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Chief prosecutor Yen Ta-ho said the Rebar scandal case has broken
many records in Taiwan's judicial history, including record high
jail terms and fines for a single suspect, a record high amount
of money involved in the alleged economic crimes committed by the
group, a record high number of 4,000 prosecutors and related
legal workers mobilized for the investigation, which required two
full months, 100 boxes of related documents and a thick 940-page
indictment book.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his wife, who were placed on Taiwan's most-wanted list
Jan. 15, are suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in
corporate funds from the Rebar Group before fleeing to China late
last year and then to the United States in January.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan officials have tried in vain to persuade the U.S.
authorities to deport Wang from Los Angeles so he can face
charges, but Wang remains in detention at a San Pedro immigration
holding center for illegal entry into the United States, where he
has been incarcerated since Feb. 2. Wang's wife, who holds U.S.
citizenship, was allowed to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
Wang tried to return to Los Angeles Feb. 2 although both his
Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports had been
canceled, following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
At Wang's first appearance at an immigration court in the
detention center Feb. 13, Wang's attorney persuaded the judge to
issue a gag order preventing anybody involved in the case from
making any information public.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Taiwan officials have had no success in gaining
information about the case.
