TAIWAN HOG RAISERS URGED TO CLEAN UP TO PREVENT PIG DISEASE

Tainan,  July 27 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Responding to a spate of human deaths in China due to a pig epidemic,
authorities from the Tainan County Livestock Disease Control Center
urged hog raisers in the southern county to strengthen clean-up and
sanitation on hog raising farms to prevent pig diseases from erupting
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Tainan livestock disease control authorities said that although it
is rare that humans can contract the streptococcus suis II bacteria
from pigs -- only a single, nonfatal, case has been recorded in Taiwan
over the last 10 years -- keeping hog raising farms clean and
sterilized is still the only way of keeping pig disease at bay.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the earliest incidence of the disease was reported in
Europe in the 1950s, with the first case of human infection occurring
in Denmark in 1968, the authorities said the disease can spread only
through direct contact, which is unlikely to happen in Taiwan at
present because Taiwan does not allow pigs or pork to be imported from
China.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the disease, they said, hog raisers and workers at pig
farms and slaughterhouses should avoid making direct contact with the
animals, especially if such people have cuts or open wounds on their
hands.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they went on, smuggling of pigs or pork from China should
be rooted out completely and people should be warned never to eat pork
from pigs that have died of disease.
</P>
<P>
Tainan County is the third-largest pig producing area in Taiwan behind
Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, also in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
News reports from Hong Kong said Friday that over 150 people have been
affected by the streptococcus suis II bacteria from pigs in China's
southwestern province of Sichuan as of noon Friday. Of the total, 31
have died.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, five such cases have been reported as of that day since
May 2004. Hong Kong had been importing pork from at least three
Chinese provinces, including Sichuan, until last week.
