</HEADLINE>

Kinmen,  Jan. 18 (CNA) (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen traveled to the
frontline island of Kinmen Sunday to inspect disease control measures
there ahead of the Jan. 22 Chinese New Year festival.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China are
expected to return home for Chinese New Year celebrations via direct
shipping services between Kinmen and Xiamen in the southeastern
mainland province of Fujian in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Chen said health checks and quarantine measures at Kinmen's airport
and wharves must be strengthened amid reports of suspected cases of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the southern mainland
province of Guangdong, which borders Fujian.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting fever-screening operations at Kinmen's Shuitou wharf
and Shanyi airport, Chen said he was satisfied with the Kinmen county
government's disease control efforts. All passengers arriving from
Xiamen must be checked for fever at Shuitou wharf and again at Shangyi
airport before they can board a Taiwan-bound flight.
</P>
<P>
In addition to SARS, Chen said Taiwan has also gone on heightened
alert to the possible spread of avian flu and he urged Kinmen security
and health authorities to cooperate closely to prevent smuggling of
livestock from the mainland to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen told Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng that the
DOH has decided to upgrade the current Kinmen county government-run
hospital to a DOH-run facility.
</P>
<P>
"Once all administrative formalities are completed, Kinmen Hospital
will be upgraded as part of our efforts to improve medical and health
services to Kinmen residents, " Chen said, adding that Taiwan
businessmen operating in the Fujian area will also be able to use the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan businessmen are expected to form 30 percent to 40
percent of patients at the hospital. Kinmen lies closer to Fujian than
it does to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen was accompanied by Su Ih-jen, director-general of the DOH's
Center for Disease Control, and several other DOH officials on his
Kinmen visit.
