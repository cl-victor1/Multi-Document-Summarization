Judging from the just concluded 2007 Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) in Las Vegas, the digital audio and video entertainment
products displayed at the show have a lot of potential to become
mainstream electronics products, and Taiwan's manufacturers are
expected to grab a share of the market, a local analyst said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The CES drew 140,000 visitors from across the globe to experience
the latest consumer technology products displayed by some 2,700
exhibitors this year.
</P>
<P>
To tap trade  opportunities,  some 400 Taiwanese  consumer
electronics manufacturers took part in the show, including
AsusTek Computer,  Acer Co., Kolin Corp., Sampo Technology and
Proton Electronic.

The analyst described 2007 as "the year of the digital family, "
with high- definition television expected to take the industry by
storm due to the significant surge in penetration rate of
broadband users in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In view of this development,  prime hardware manufactures,
including Dell, Kolin, Sony, Teco and Acer, are all attaching
great importance to the liquid crystal display (LCD) TV market,
and Hewlett Packard Co. has placed a focus on Internet Protocol
Television.

<P>
Meanwhile, notebook computer manufactures Quanta and Compal are
setting up new assembly lines for expected OEM (original
equipment manufacturer) orders for LCDs.

The anticipated digital family boom is expected to boost the
development of Taiwan's information technology and boost OEM
orders as well, the analyst said.
