Taipei, Jan. 14 (CNA) 01/14/07  16:10:10 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Taiwan has entered a peak influenza period, and those people who
have developed flu-like symptoms should not take them lightly but
should see a doctor immediately, health authorities warned
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health pointed out that 68 new cases
of flu-like illness have been reported in Taiwan this year, with
13 having been confirmed as serious influenza cases.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the 13 serious flu patients were all
youngsters under 18 years of age and that most of them had
contracted influenza type B, with one of the patients having died
from complications.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said that although
influenza type B is not as serious as type A, patients with flu-
like symptoms who put off seeking medical care risk developing
serious complications, such as meningitis or pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the frequent contact among students is a major reason
why the flu epidemic can spread more easily among young people.
</P>
<P>
People showing flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and sore
throat, should consult a doctor immediately, he said, adding that
they should avoid crowds and stay home to get a lot of rest.
</P>
<P>
Influenza is a viral disease that usually strikes between October
and May and can be transmitted from one person to another through
the air. Symptoms include aching muscles and joints, headaches,
cough, fever and fatigue. Sudden changes in temperature may cause
the symptoms to appear more quickly.
</P>
<P>
According  to doctors, flu vaccination  is still the best
preventive measure for those in high-risk groups, including
senior citizens and people with heart or lung diseases.
