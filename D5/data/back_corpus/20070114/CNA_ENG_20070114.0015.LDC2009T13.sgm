MAJORITY FAVOR ADOPTING PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA) 01/14/07  19:55:52 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
A majority of the Taiwan people are in favor of adopting a
parliamentary system of government, even though they do not have
a clear picture concerning the parliamentary form of government,
according to the results of a recent public opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the private Taiwan Thinktank at the
beginning of 2007 on the topic constitutional reform, found that
56.5 percent of the people favor a "parliamentary system" for the
central government, compared with 19.3 percent who favor a
"presidential system."
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary system is distinguished by the executive branch
of government being dependent on the direct or indirect support
of the parliament. Hence, there is no clear-cut separation of
powers between the executive and legislative branches, leading to
a lack of checks and balances found in a presidential system.
</P>
<P>
Some believe that one of the advantages of the parliamentary
system is that it is easier to pass legislation. This is because
the executive branch is formed by the majority party in the
legislative branch and often includes members of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
One of the main criticisms of many parliamentary systems is that
the head of government cannot be directly voted on. The head of
government is usually the leader of the party with a majority in
the parliament. In a presidential system, like the one seen in
the United States, the head of state is chosen directly by the
people through presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
While over 56 percent  of the respondents  in the Taiwan
Thinktank's survey said they favor a "parliamentary system, "
61.7 percent of these respondents also said they do not agree
that direct presidential elections should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poll also found that over three-fourths of the
respondents disagree  with the notion of legislators  serving
concurrently as Cabinet ministers, which is a major feature of
the parliamentary system of government.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher with Academia Sinica's
Institute of Social Sciences, said that the poll shows that many
people in Taiwan have contradictory stances on the issue of what
system of government should be adopted in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The poll results  --  which either  reflect  the people's
disappointment with the performance of Taiwan's legislators or
with the existing "presidential system" -- are worth further
study, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ming-tung, a National Taiwan University professor, said the
poll results show that the Taiwan public is still deeply attached
to direct presidential elections, a fact which he noted would
block the implementation of a parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yun-ping, an adviser to Taiwan Thinktank, noted that 70
percent of the respondents who favor a "parliamentary system" are
members or supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party.
</P>
<P>
"These people are probably opposed to a 'President Chen system, '
rather than the presidential system itself, " Wang claimed,
adding that they will change their stance if KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou is elected president in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed that the "presidential  system" will be more
beneficial to Taiwan in the long run if the power of the
Legislative Yuan is readjusted and regulated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  the poll also found that 61.2 percent of the
respondents think the Republic of China's territory only includes
Taiwan proper and the offshore islands of Penghu, Kinmen and
Matsu, while only 22.5 percent agree with the ROC Constitution's
definition of the ROC's territory as including mainland China and
Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76.1 percent of the respondents said Taiwan's
sovereignty belongs to the 23 million people of Taiwan, while
only 15 percent said it belongs to the people of Taiwan and the
1.4 billion people living on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yu-tsung, an associate professor at Shih Hsin University, said
the path could be long for Taiwan in carrying out real
constitutional reform or re-engineering since the issue is still
unclear to most of the people in Taiwan, whom he claimed are
either unfamiliar with the contents and terms of the Constitution
or care only about political affiliations.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,088 adults randomly selected around the island was
conducted Jan. 4-6 by telephone. It has a margin of error of plus
or minus 2.9 percentage points.
