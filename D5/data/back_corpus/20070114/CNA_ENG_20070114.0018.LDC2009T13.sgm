CABINET DISMISSES 'RIFT' REPORT AS 'POLITICAL RHAPSODY'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  14 (CNA) 01/14/07  23:30:41 (By Sofia Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Su Tseng-chang share common
views on the handling of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group financial
fiasco and do not have any rift over this incident, Cabinet
spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng was responding to a media report which claimed that the
country's two top political leaders were divided over the Rebar
case and that Chen has pressured Su to get to the bottom of the
cause of the Rebar storm and harshly discipline all those
accountable for the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The report was sheer speculation and like a free-flowing
'political rhapsody' without any factual support," Cheng said,
adding that Chen and Su share similar views on the Rebar case.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities are investigating a spate of corporate
crimes allegedly involving many of the Rebar's 120-odd
subsidiaries after two affiliates -- China Rebar Co. and Chia
Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., applied for insolvency
protection late last year which triggered a run on the Chinese
Bank, also a Rebar offshoot. The group's 82-year-old founder,
Wang You-theng, had fled to China with his fourth wife before
prosecutors issued a warrant banning the couple and many of their
family members and Rebar executives from leaving the country
pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
The crimes allegedly committed by Rebar affiliates included
insider trading, phony accounting practices, fraud, forgery and
violations of the banking law and accounting regulations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many of the Rebar group's suspected irregularities
could be tracked to the previous Kuomintang administration era,
Cheng said both the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan
define the Rebar incident as a case involving "transitional
justice" that should be pursued to the full extent of law to
quell public discontent over the government's failure to prevent
occurrence of all those corporate scandals.
</P>
<P>
As to the direction, determination and approach to be applied in
handling the Rebar case, Cheng said Chen and Su share a "high-
degree of consensus."
</P>
<P>
Cheng further said Chen and Su didn't have any rift over any
other major police affairs.
