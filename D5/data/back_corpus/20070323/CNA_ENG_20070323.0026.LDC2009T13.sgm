Taipei, March 23 (CNA) 03/23/07  18:43:05 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The season during which calla lilies bloom at Yangmingshan's
Zhuzi Lake formally began Friday and will last 38 days until
April 29.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Taipei city government's Department of Economic
Development noted that this year's calla lily flower season
arrived a week earlier than in previous years, mainly because
Taiwan had a warm winter as a result of global warming.
</P>
<P>
The calla lilly season at Zhuzi Lake is one of Taipei's five
major flower events of the year. Another major event -- the
flower festival at Yangmingshan National Park that began Feb. 20
-- will end March 25.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 growers have planted 12 hectares of calla lily
fields in the Zhuzi Lake valley, which will produce some 3
million flowers this year, worth NT$30 million, and accounting
for 90 percent of Taiwan's total calla lily production.
</P>
<P>
The calla lily flowers grown at Zhuzi Lake are mostly pristine
white. They have chalice-shaped flowers with a strong stem, and
are a favored choice in flower arrangements because they are
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can enjoy the fun of going into a field to pluck for
themselves the flowers they wish to buy.
</P>
<P>
Officials  at the Taipei city government's  Department  of
Transportation said people planning a trip to Zhuzi Lake to see
the flowers in bloom on the weekend should travel by city bus,
instead of driving their own vehicles, in order to avoid traffic
congestion.
