TIME FOR OPPOSITION LAWMAKER TO SERVE TIME BEHIND BARS: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 23 (CNA) 03/23/07  17:19:20 (By Lilian Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday that since opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yu has been sentenced for one-year-
and-two-month prison term, relevant government agencies should
see to it that he serves the time behind bars.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during a question-and-answer session
at the Legislative Yuan, one day after the Supreme Court rejected
an appeal by Chiu seeking to overturn the prison sentence imposed
by a lower court for his role in a violent protest at the
Kaohsiung District Court shortly after the presidential election
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Su said "the public can't forget the scene in which Chiu led a
group of protesters  attacking Kaohsiung district court's main
entrance in the southern port city in the wee hours of March 21,
2004, which led to the injuries of eight policemen on duty."
</P>
<P>
Chiu and the protestors demanded the court to impound ballot
boxes after the KMT's candidate Lien Chan lost to President Chen
Shui-bian by a razor-thin margin. The KMT had accused Chen of
staging a shooting on the eve of the March 20, 2004 presidential
election, which it claimed swayed the election outcome in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin said Friday that the
ministry has asked the Supreme Prosecutors Office to deal with
the matter concerning Chiu according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Prosecutors Office said that it will notify Chiu within a
week to begin serving the prison term. If Chiu fails to report to
the authorities, it will take follow-up measures.
</P>
<P>
Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung
also said that Chiu will be disqualified from running in the
year-end legislative election after the Supreme Court handed out
the final ruling.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that those wishing to run in the legislative election
have to meet certain qualifications, and that Chiu is not
expected to serve out his sentence by the time elections are
held. Even if he is released on parole, Chiu will still not be
eligible to stand as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that if the KMT wishes to nominate Chiu as its at-
large legislative candidate, then the CEC will convene a meeting
to discuss whether Chiu is qualified to run.
</P>
<P>
Chiu, who last year exposed first lady Wu Shu-jen's suspected
involvement in the misuse of a public fund for President Chen
Shui-bian to conduct "state affairs" which led to her indictment
in November 2006, claimed Thursday that the sentence is
politically motivated, and aims to silence him before he can
expose further government irregularities.
