NEW NAME PLAQUE UNVEILING WILL NOT DAMAGE CKS MEMORIAL HALL:
MAYOR
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  21:15:40 (By Flor Wang)

Although a new name plaque is to be affixed to the Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall in line with the ruling party's name-change
drive, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Friday that the city
government has been given assurances by the central authorities
that no damage will be done to the hall.
</P>
<P>
Hau made the remarks while answering questions from councilors
during a question-and-answer session at the Taipei City Council
on the eve of the Executive Yuan's planned unveiling of a plague
bearing the hall's new name -- "National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Taipei city government does not intend to
counteract the central government concerning the issue but has
made full preparations before the Ministry of Education (MOE)
makes the move, Hau said that he will take the Executive Yuan's
"no damage" promise as being made in good faith.
</P>
<P>
Amid speculation that the municipal and central governments might
have a confrontation Saturday over the issue, Hau said that the
"pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green camp" must not turn it
into an "ideological strife" and must not take advantage of it to
create a row.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yung-ping, director of the municipal cultural affairs bureau,
said that municipal  officials  have in recent days conducted
inspections of the hall's perimeter to prevent any "precipitous
moves" by the MOE.
</P>
<P>
As the MOE has informed the bureau that it will erect scaffolding
around the hall Saturday to carry out "maintenance work" on the
building until June 20, doing so will hide the CKS Memorial
Hall's original name plaque from public view and allow MOE
officials to "legally" unveil the new plaque, Lee said, adding
that bureau officials have seen the name plate and that it is to
be installed on the ground rather than mounted on a wall.
</P>
<P>
But MOE officials have so far failed to publicly explain how they
plan to install the new name plaque or what shape it is.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Police Department chief Wang Cho-chiun said that some
700 policemen will be mobilized Saturday at the hall to prevent
clashes.
</P>
<P>
The CKS Memorial Hall, constructed by the then-ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) in downtown Taipei in memory of the late president who died
in 1975, is viewed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) as a remnant of a tyrannical regime.
</P>
<P>
The name change for the complex has become a focal point as the
MOE is set to put the new name plaque on the hall despite fierce
opposition from the Taipei city government.
</P>
<P>
After the DPP rekindled the name-change campaign in January this
year, the Taipei city government proclaimed the CKS Memorial Hall
a "heritage site" in a move to protect the building from being
modified or transformed by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei municipal authorities have repeatedly said that anyone
caught causing damage to the building and its compound will be
dealt with in accordance with the law, including personnel of the
MOE, which oversees the hall's operations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference earlier the same day, a group of
KMT city councilors accused the MOE's method of unveiling the new
plaque of being "unlawful."
</P>
<P>
They said that the Taipei city government must not compromise
over the issue and must act in compliance with the law if the
plaque unveiling involves any illegal measures.
