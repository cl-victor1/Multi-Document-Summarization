NEW MND HEAD TO MAINTAIN POLITICAL STABILITY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  22:08:32 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
The appointment of a senior military officer to head the Ministry
of National Defense (MND) was made in the hope of maintaining
political  stability  prior to two significant elections, Vice
Premier-designate Chiou I-jen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The choice  was made after taking  various  factors  into
consideration, including political stability, the priorities of
the MND, and ways for the government to face continuous
confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties, Chiou
said.
</P>
<P>
He offered the explanation in response to media inquiries on an
earlier announcement by Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung that
he had named former Chief of the General Staff Lee Tien-yu as the
new minister of national defense, replacing Lee Jye, who will be
retiring.
</P>
<P>
The appointment incurred doubt about President Chen Shui-bian's
pledge to put the military under civilian control.
</P>
<P>
Lee, an air force general, served as air force combat commander,
deputy commander-in-chief and commander-in-chief before taking
office as the MND's chief of the general staff May 20, 2004. Lee
was transferred from the position to serve as a strategy advisor
to the president Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
Chiou, who currently serves as chief of staff to the president,
said Chen's biggest concern is that he has only a year left of
his presidential term and that during the year-end legislative
elections and the 2008 presidential election, it is more
important for the MND to have a leader capable of maintaining the
neutrality and stability of the armed forces, Chiou said.
</P>
<P>
As the elections approach, Chiou predicted that interparty
clashes will even exacerbate and that the MND therefore needs to
be more careful and cautious in the face of sensitive political
changes.
