Washington,  May 17 (CNA) 05/18/07  10:41:12 (By Jorge Liu and

The United States will not sacrifice Taiwan even though it needs
China's support or assistance in dealing with issues regarding
North Korea, Iran and Iraq, Taiwan's new representative to the
United States said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.  officials have repeatedly  assured us that Taiwan's
interests will not be compromised simply because they need
China's support in resolving issues involving Iran, North Korea
and Iraq," Joseph Wu said in an interview with CNA.
</P>
<P>
Since he took office in Washington, D.C. a month ago, Wu said, he
has made extensive contacts with U.S. officials, congressional
members and think tank scholars.
</P>
<P>
"Through all those direct dialogue and engagements, I feel
confident that the United States will not lobby China at Taiwan's
expense," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said he feels the pinch of China's expanding
clout in the world arena and that China is cashing in on U.S.
preoccupation with thorny foriegn policy issues involving North
Korea, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"China is indeed exploiting Washington's concentration on those
issues to expand its political clout and step up its military
buildup and its suppression of Taiwan diplomatically." Wu
lamented.
</P>
<P>
On his work agenda, Wu said that if the government decides to
apply for a seat in the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan"
this autumn, he will definitely go all out to seek U.S. support
for Taiwan's U.N. bid.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he will try his utmost to help Americans understand the
use of Taiwan or the Republic of China as the country's title
fully comply with Taiwan's status quo. Claiming that China should
be held responsible for changing Taiwan's name in the
international community, Wu said that under China's pressure,
Taiwan has to use designation other than its national title "the
Republic of China" while joining world bodies. "It is China that
changes Taiwan's name, not us," Wu said, referring to the fact
that Taiwan uses such titles as "Chinese Taipei" in come world
organizations.
