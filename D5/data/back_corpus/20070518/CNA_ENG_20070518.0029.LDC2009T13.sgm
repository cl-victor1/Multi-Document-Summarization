A rare kingfisher was saved Friday at a forest park in the
southeastern county of Taitung after it flew into a bird net
while trying to escape a hawk eagle.
</P>
<P>
A ranger in the Dulanshan Forest Park, in which the ruddy
kindfisher was caught, said he was alerted by the bird's cries.
</P>
<P>
The bird is widely distributed in East and Southeast Asia,
ranging from South Korea and Japan in the north, south through
the Philippines, and west to China and India.
</P>
<P>
The bird migrates from the Philippines to Japan's Ryukyu islands
in summer. Normally it only flies along the eastern coast of
Taiwan without traveling inland, the ranger said, speculating
that the accidental tourist might have made a detour to the
forest park looking for food.
</P>
<P>
The bird was released after being fed.
