PREMIER-DESIGNATE BIDS FAREWELL TO LEGISLATIVE YUAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  19:17:06 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung bid farewell Friday to the
Legislative Yuan and expressed hope for better coordination
between the executive and legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a lawmaker since 1983, made the remarks to his legislative
peers after receiving a presidential decree earlier the same day
from President Chen Shui- bian officially naming him as the new
premier from May 21. He will take over the post from outgoing
Premier Su Tseng-chang, who offered to resign last week.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who also serves as chairman of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, will also have to quit that position next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Voicing satisfaction with what he has gone through during
Taiwan's democratization in the past 20 years and spelling out
his pride in Taiwan, Chang urged the country's political leaders
to hear the people's voices and lead the nation to improve its
democratic system.
</P>
<P>
"The next time I am here I will be interrogated by lawmakers in
my capacity as premier, " Chang said, vowing to do his best to
lead the Executive Yuan and effectively coordinate with the
Legislative Yuan after assuming the premiership.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time Chang has held the premiership. He
first served from October 2000 until January 2002 after the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in May
2000.
</P>
<P>
Chang is best remembered for his halting in late 2000 of the
construction of the fourth nuclear power plant in Kungliao
township in Taipei County, a move that sent the domestic bourse
crumbling to around 3,500 points from a relative high of over
8,000 points when Chen first became president.
</P>
<P>
"Pan-blue alliance" lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party proclaimed him "persona non
grata" after he gave the order to halt the building of the
nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
This time around, the "pan-blue" lawmakers have labeled him
"extremely unqualified" for the premiership due to what they say
was Chang's poor performance during his first tenure.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Chang, DPP lawmaker Lu Tien-lin will also quit his
legislative seat to take the oath as chairman of the Council of
Labor Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who has long served as a proxy for the large number of grass-
roots workers in the Legislative Yuan, promised to take care of
laborers' needs after entering the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced the adjournment
of the session later that day, leaving several critical issues
untouched, including the 2007 central government budget bill and
the draft Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law.
</P>
<P>
The two bills have been stonewalled for more than five months in
the Legislative Yuan due to squabbling between "pan-blue"
legislators and "pan-green" lawmakers of the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union as a result of their divergent positions
regarding the bills' respective passages.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue" lawmakers want the CEC Organic Law to be addressed
before the annual budget bill, but the "pan-greens" have refused
to give way in this regard, insisting that the budget bill be
approved first.
