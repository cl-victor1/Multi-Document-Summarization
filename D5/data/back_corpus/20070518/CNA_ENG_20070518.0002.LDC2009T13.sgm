DPP OFFICIAL TOPS AT-LARGE LEGISLATIVE PRIMARIES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 17 (CNA) 05/18/07  10:37:20 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) unveiled the
results of its at- large legislative primary Thursday, with DPP
Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang topping the list of 19
aspirants.
</P>
<P>
The primaries consist of a May 6 member vote, which accounts for
40 percent of the total score of a hopeful, and a series of
public opinion polls May 14-16, which account for the remaining
60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Luo Wen-jia, a young turk and former legislator, was No. 1 in the
public opinion polls. He was placed sixth after the score of the
member vote was factored in.
</P>
<P>
Luo, one of the "11 nemeses" -- as they are branded by some
radical DPP supporters -- was therefore pushed off the "safe
list" in the year-end legislative elections,  when a new "single-
member constituency, two-vote" electoral system will be adopted
and the current legislature will also be cut in half to 113
seats, including 73 seats which will be elected from regional
districts, six seats for aboriginal representatives and 34 seats
for at-large and overseas expatriate representatives.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the results fell within his expectations and that he
could accept them, although he also questioned why the party's
talent recruit mechanism is not working in sync with the results
of the public opinion polls, showing that the party member
structure has "unusual factors, " which he called for the party
leadership to pay attention to.
</P>
<P>
Luo did not elaborate, although reports about "ghost members" in
the first phase of member voting were rampant.
</P>
<P>
The eight hopefuls that made the "safe list" and can therefore be
assured of a berth in the next legislature are Tsai, former
Department of Health Minister Twu Shing-jer, and legislators Wang
Sing-nan and Gao Jyh-peng, while Council for Hakka Affairs Vice
Chairwoman Chiu Yi-ying was the top among the women hopefuls,
followed by Legislator Hsueh Lin, former Changhua County
Magistrate Wong Chin- chu and Legislator Tien Chiu-chin.
</P>
<P>
If ballots collected by the DPP in past elections are an
indicator, the party will be able to claim around 12 at-large
seats, which are awarded in proportion to a party's ballots
garnered in the elections.
</P>
<P>
As the DPP chairman can nominate one third of the at-large
legislative seats, or around four seats, and the DPP charter has
stipulated that women should account for half of the at-large
seats, this means only the top four in the men's hopefuls and
women's hopefuls can be assured seats.
</P>
<P>
Those who are widely tapped to be nominated by DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun include incumbent legislators Ker Chien-min and Trong
Chai, but some party officials have also said that if all at-
large legislative seats are taken by political figures, it may be
bad for the party's attempts to solicit wider support for the
party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group who have launched an islandwide boycott of the
"11 nemeses" of the party was elated.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese Club, which launched the drive through radio
stations and networks to boycott the 11 who "preach going
westwards" and "who criticize their own comrades," said all the
11 fared poorly in the primaries and that the Taiwanese Club has
"scored a perfect victory," said club chairman Chang Tien-chun.
</P>
<P>
Chang noted that the club sent a 60,000-signature petition to the
party early this February to demonstrate that a great number of
DPP members were complaining about the 11.
</P>
<P>
Chang claimed that "no political figures" are pulling the strings
behind his club and that the boycott was motivated by "contempt
for those who are pointing their fingers at their own comrades."
</P>
<P>
The "11 nemeses" include former legislators Lee Wen-chung and Lin
Cho-shui, who quit their legislative seats last November in
response to "the public's high expectations of the DPP" in the
wake of a series of alleged scandals involving the first family.
Both Lee and Lin failed the regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
The others include former Legislator Sheng Fu-shiung, who was
placed ninth and incumbent Legislator Hung Chi-chang, who was
placed 10th.
</P>
<P>
Hung, one of the founders of the once powerful but now disbanded
New Tide faction, said he accepted the poor results of the
faction but he was nevertheless defiant.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the defeat in one battle will not mean that the New
Tide faction will disappear from the battlefield or that its
ideals have been defeated."
</P>
<P>
Lin Cho-shui,  who quit the first  phase of the regional
legislative primaries after faring poorly in the member voting,
said the DPP "owes an explanation to society" for unveiling such
a "lackluster" at-large legislative list.
