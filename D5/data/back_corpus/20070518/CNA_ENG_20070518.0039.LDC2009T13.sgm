Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen instructed his
ministry Friday to redouble efforts to attract investment by
domestic and foreign manufacturers, especially those in the
photovoltaic polysilicon sector.
</P>
<P>
Chen issued the directive while chairing a meeting on luring more
investment to Taiwan, during which he said the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) has given the green light to 476 major
investment projects for a total value of NT$539.7 billion during
the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for 53.63 percent of the targeted amount of
NT$1.0065 trillion which was set by the MOEA for this year's new
investment projects by the private sector, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the MOEA will give top priority to
promoting investment in the production of polysilicon, the raw
material used to make photovoltaic power.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA is working hard to accelerate development of the
Kaohsiung Software- based Technology Park and to woo investment
from the information  software, digital  content,  electronics
and telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Water Resources Agency is also planning to invest
around NT$150 million over the next three years to promote the
deep seawater industry.
