Taipei,  May  18 (CNA) 05/18/07  16:27:39 (By Deborah Kuo)

Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung is expected to name former
Chief of the General Staff Lee Tien-yu as the new minister of
national defense, replacing Lee Jye, who will be retiring,
political sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chang is also expected to appoint Taiwan's representative to
Germany, Shieh Jhy- wey, to serve as the new minister of the
Government Information Office, succeeding Cheng Wen-tsang,  who
resigned earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
These two appointments are expected to be formally announced by
the Government Information Office later Friday as part of the
ongoing Cabinet reshuffle. The new Cabinet is scheduled to be
sworn in Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Chang met with Lee Friday morning and
Lee consented to the appointment as defense minister. Chang also
obtained Shieh's consent earlier the same day regarding his new
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said, Minister of Foreign Affairs James
Huang,  Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong  and
Directorate  General  of  Budget, Accounting  and  Statistics
Director-General Hsu Chang-yao are expected to be retained.
</P>
<P>
Chang, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , was
appointed by President Chen Shui-bian as the new premier Monday
to succeed  outgoing  Premier Su Tseng-chang,  who submitted  his
resignation May 12, one week after he lost the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party presidential primary to his predecessor, Frank
Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who served as the first Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
premier between 2000-2002, announced a second wave of personnel
appointments the day before, following the first wave announced
Wednesday, when he appointed Presidential Office Secretary-
General Chiou I-jen as the new vice premier and Deputy
Transportation and Communications Minister Chen Ching-chun as the
next Executive Yuan secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said Thursday that although Chang is being
allowed a very short period of time to shape his new Cabinet,
Chang's administrative team is expected to be on track soon,
given that the former premier and SEF chairman has no faction
affiliations and is enjoying a free hand in conducting the
personnel reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Chang will quit his SEF post after assuming premiership. SEF Vice
Chairman and Secretary-General You Ying-lung is expected to serve
as acting chairman for the time being.
