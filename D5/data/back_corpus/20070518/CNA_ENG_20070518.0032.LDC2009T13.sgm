Taiwan's Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai called on Yuichiro
Ito, governor of Kagoshima Prefecture, Thursday to discuss
tourism affairs.
</P>
<P>
Koh visited Ito at the invitation of Kagoshima-based Iwasaki
Corp.. He also called on Masuo Kaneko, chairman of the
prefecture's sightseeing association, in the company of Yoshitaro
Iwasaki, chairman of Iwasaki Corp.
</P>
<P>
Ito said that Kagoshima, located in the southeast part of Japan,
is very close to Taiwan in terms of geography and that Taiwan and
Kagoshima have for a long time engaged in exchanges, which will
be helpful as a basis for future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ito and Masuo, who have both visited Taiwan and who have a good
impression of the country, expressed the hope that charter
flights between Taiwan and Kagoshima can be resumed in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
When there were charter flights between the two sides, some
45,000 Taiwanese tourists visited Kagoshima per year, but the
number of Taiwanese visitors declined after the charter flights
were canceled, Ito said, adding that only about 14,000 Taiwanese
tourists visited the prefecture in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Koh told Ito that Taiwan's government is encouraging local-level
exchanges between Japan and Taiwan. He recommended Taiwan's
Taichung City and Ylan County to Ito, saying that these two
places are capable of facilitating tourism exchanges because of
their convenient transportation networks and their historical
relations with Kagoshima Prefecture.
