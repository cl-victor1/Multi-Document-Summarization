Taipei, May 18 (CNA) 05/18/07  18:18:51 (By Y.F. Low)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng denied Friday a media
report that he has decided to turn down opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) presidential nominee Ma Ying- jeou's offer to be his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he is still heeding the opinions of the people,
especially those in southern Taiwan, and is thinking over the
matter seriously because he hopes the KMT can field a strong
ticket to boost its chances of victory in the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that whatever decision he makes, he will offer his full
support to the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who was named by the KMT early this month as the party's
candidate for the 2008 presidential election, officially invited
Wang to become his running mate last week.
</P>
<P>
Without accepting the invitation immediately, Wang said he will
make a decision before the KMT's national congress, slated for
June 24, when Ma's nomination is expected to be passed by the
congress.
