Washington,  March  27  (CNA) (By Herman Pan)

<P>
Canberra, March 28 (CNA): Taiwan is marching ahead of Europe, the
United States, Japan and Australia to pick up bargains and break down
foreign investment restrictions in cash-strapped Southeast Asia in the
wake of the financial crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch from Bangkok Saturday, The mass-circulation Sydney
Morning Herald reported a high-level delegation of Taiwan's China
Development Corporation (CDC), led by its director Liu Tai-ying, had
visited Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines and signed a
string of financial and investment deals. CDC is expected to enter
into discussions on many more deals in the same region.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted analysts as saying that influential tycoons in
Malaysia and Indonesia are being targeted by Taiwan because of the
financial and diplomatic advantages available through their political
connections.
</P>
<P>
It also said Taiwan's use of the regional financial crisis to build
government-to-government contacts is causing growing consternation in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysts, Malaysia, which is in desperate need of
capital injections, is set to increase the maximum financial sector
investment from 30 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that this relaxation could be a staged move towards
allowing majority foreign stakes on a case by case basis.
</P>
<P>
The daily reported Taiwan is believed to have played a major role in
an expected Malaysian government move to ease restrictions on foreign
investment in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Liu and his delegation had talks with Malaysian tycoon
Rashid Hussain, whose RHB group has said the CDC will buy out the Sime
Bank, which in the last six months of 1997 suffered a 1.6 billion
ringgit (US$423 million) loss.
</P>
<P>
The daily also reported the CDC is negotiating a possible merger deal
with Amsteel Mills, which is part of the influential Lion Group of
companies.
</P>
<P>
The CDC group earlier held discussions in Jakarta on property and
other investments with the Lippo Group, which is politically close to
the family of President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the CDC has taken a 62 percent interest in Bangkok First
Investment and Trust Plc and plans to later dilute its holdings by
acquiring strategic local partners, the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is a once-in-lifetime opportunity...It is the financial crisis
which has opened the door for the CDC to jump in," a senior CDC
investment adviser was quoted as saying.
