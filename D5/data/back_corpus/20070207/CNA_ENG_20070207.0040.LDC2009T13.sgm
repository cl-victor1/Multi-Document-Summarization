The NSO's executive director, Joyce Chiou said the NSO will join

Singapore's Esplanade-Theaters on the Bay. Chiou pointed out that
this performance is the first step to bringing the NSO back onto
the international stage.

The NSO will follow the theme of "Philharmonic Taiwan" by
presenting three music works composed by Taiwanese musicians: the
"Capriccio of Kuan-du for Piano and Orchestra" by Ma Shuei-lung,

Concerto for Orchestra" by Pan Huan-lung.
