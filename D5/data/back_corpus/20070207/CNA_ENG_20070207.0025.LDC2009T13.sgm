FOREIGN WORKERS WELCOME TO FILE COMPLAINTS IF MALTREATED: CLA

Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA) 02/07/07  17:30:08 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Foreign workers are welcome to lodge petitions with relevant
labor agencies whenever they are improperly treated, a Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Meng-liang, a division chief at the CLA's Bureau of
Employment and Vocational Training, was responding to Philippine
media reports that Filipina housemaids and caregivers have
complained about their Taiwanese employers' reluctance to offer
them days off.
</P>
<P>
As many of the Filipinas are afraid of losing their jobs, the
reports said, they dare not argue with their employers to take a
day off per week.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Tsai said, employers might "viciously" fire foreign
workers, but the situation has improved since last October when a
new set of protective measures for foreign laborers were put into
force.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, local governments are required to verify
every case involving firing, advanced termination of contract and
repatriation of foreign laborers and should assist in handling
disputes between local employers and foreign employees.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tsai said, special counters have been opened at major
airports for disgruntled foreign laborers, particularly those who
feel their legitimate rights have been denied, to file their
grievances  and seek legal remedies before their departure or
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that employment and management of foreign workers must
comply with existing law and working contracts, Tsai said local
employers will be fined and even deprived of their qualification
to hire foreign workers if they are found to have committed any
infractions.
</P>
<P>
Given all these extensive protective  measures,  Tsai said
maltreated foreign workers need not hesitate to voice complaints
through legal channels.
