Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA) 02/07/07  20:18:20 (TIER)  and South
Korea's Samsung Economic Research Institute  (SERI) (By Elisa
Kao)
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research signed a cooperation
agreement Wednesday to jointly study the impact that investment
by Taiwan and South Korea in China will have on their economies.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was presided over by TIER President David S.
Hong and SERI CEO Kim Kyeong-Won in Taipei, with both sides
promising to cooperate in the study of Taiwanese and South Korean
investment in China and its impact on their respective economies.
</P>
<P>
The two think tanks agreed to release reports in this regard in
June both in Taipei and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the agreement, Kim delivered a brief report
about SERI's point of view regarding the changes in investment
patterns of Asian countries during the last several decades.
</P>
<P>
According to SERI's report, Asian countries have shifted their
focus from Japan during the last several decades to China
currently.
</P>
<P>
With China's rise, it is necessary for Asian countries to make a
thorough study of how they deploy their investment in this
market, especially for Taiwan and South Korea, which have
experienced a mass exodus of their high-tech companies to China
in recent years, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, it is a necessity for both Taiwan and
South Korea to jointly study how their investment in China will
influence their respective economies, according to Kim.
</P>
<P>
Hong noted that TIER's cooperation with the SERI marks a
milestone in the institute's march toward internationalization.
