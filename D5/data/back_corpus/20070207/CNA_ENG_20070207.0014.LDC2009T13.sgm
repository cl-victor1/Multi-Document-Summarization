CONSUMERS' FOUNDATION CALLS FOR CERTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR PORK
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA) 02/07/07  16:55:18 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Foundation called for the government Wednesday to
help build a certification system for pork products amid reports
that tainted pork from sick and dead hogs has once again appeared
in markets around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Consumers' Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung said relevant
government agencies' efficiency is open to doubt, with illicit
selling of sick and dead hogs to consumers occurring every year
since 2001 even though the matter has been one of the top 10
consumer news items every year.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said building a pork certification system is the only
effective way of curbing tainted pork sales, as the business is
too lucrative to be ignored and the penalties meted out by the
government are too lenient.
</P>
<P>
Since violators of regulations banning the sale of pork from sick
and dead hogs are usually released on bail of just NT$50,000,
Cheng suggested that the government impose heavier penalties on
violators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Luo Chiu-ying, a member of the Consumer's Foundation,
said that to counteract the marketing of tainted pork, consumers
should avoid buying pork from unknown sources or pork at prices
much cheaper than street value.
</P>
<P>
Buying pork products carrying the CAS label at supermarkets or
hypermarkets is also safer, Luo added.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the foundation has found that only a small number of
meat dealers have been involved in the crime -- Taiwan people
consume about 9 million head of hogs each year, with about 30,000
head slaughtered every month -- and the latest news report about
the busting of a ring in the southern county of Pingtung
indicates that only about 20 to 50 sick and dead hogs have been
sold to meat markets per day recently.
</P>
<P>
The Pingtung District Prosecutor's Office a day earlier released
11 suspects on bail after law enforcement officers detained them
Monday on charges of selling pork from sick and dead hogs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,500 kg of tainted pork was reportedly seized in a
raid along with the Pingtung ring, which included seven people
licensed to transport sick and dead hogs for safe disposal, as
well as several hired hands.
</P>
<P>
The latest crackdown  in Pingtung  County  came after law
enforcement agents in Yunlin County, central Taiwan, raided five
illegal slaughterhouses Feb. 1, arresting one suspect and seizing
30 metric tons of tainted pork believed to have been stashed to
meet the increased demand for meat during the Lunar New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the Council of Agriculture's Animal
Industry Department said they will accelerate the installation of
global positioning systems (GPS) on vehicles contracted to
transport sick and dead hogs for safe disposal so that they can
be monitored.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they will also step up raids on unlicensed
slaughterhouses and  push  for the implementation  of a pork
certification system, beginning with supermarkets and
hypermarkets.
