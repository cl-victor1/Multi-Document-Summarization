CRAM SCHOOLS TO BE BANNED FROM ENROLLING CHILDREN UNDER 6

The Executive Yuan approved an amendment to the Supplementary and
Continuing Education Law Wednesday that will prohibit cram
schools from enrolling children under the age of six.
</P>
<P>
According to Cabinet officials, education of preschool children
should focus on health and ethical education and should be
closely linked with family education, and the amendment is
designed at laying a sound base for the mental and physical
development of children.
</P>
<P>
However, cram schools that offer children under six classes
related to rhythm and artistic training will not be included on
the list of prohibited schools, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese parents tend to push their children from a very early
age into various cram schools to receive supplementary courses
outside the formal education system in a wide variety of subjects
to prepare them for their entry into the fierce job market.
</P>
<P>
The tendency has resulted in a country swarming with cram schools
and enviable incomes for teachers in these schools -- plus a
group of unhappy children.
</P>
<P>
The amendment will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval,
the officials said, adding that once approved, violators will
receive a warning to follow the new regulations or face fines of
between NT$50,000 and NT$200,000, with serious violators getting
their licenses revoked.
