President Chen Shui-bian will be present Friday at a memorial
ceremony for Yang Chuan-kwang,  Taiwan's legendary decathlete who
died of a stroke in California at the age of 74,  and will award
a presidential  citation to honor Yang's contribution to the
nation, an organizer of the event said Wednesday.

The ceremony will be held at Chi-nan Presbyterian Church, near
the Legislative Yuan, said Tsai Szu-chung, Vice Chairman of the
Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee and chief organizer of the
ceremony, adding that the Christian form of a memorial service
was chosen in accordance with the wishes of the Yangs, a
Christian family.

President of the National College of Physical Education and
Sports, Chou Hung- Shih, will serve as presider, and Chi-Cheng, a
former athlete who won bronze in the women's 80-meter low hurdles
at the 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics, will deliver a eulogy,
Tsai said.

Yang, born in 1933, won gold in the decathlon at the 1954 Asian
Games in Manila. Dubbed theIron man of Asia, he won gold again at
the 1958 Tokyo Asian Games and took silver at the 1960 Rome
Olympics after a duel with his UCLA schoolmate Rafer Johnson of
the United States. It was the first Olympic medal Taiwan had ever
won.

Yang's family held his cremation near Los Angeles Feb. 3, after
his last wish that his body be buried in the National Sports
Training Center in Kaohsiung was denied by Taiwanese authorities
on the grounds that it would not be legal. The government sent
delegates to attend the funeral and covered Yang's coffin with
both the national flag and Taiwan's Olympic flag.
