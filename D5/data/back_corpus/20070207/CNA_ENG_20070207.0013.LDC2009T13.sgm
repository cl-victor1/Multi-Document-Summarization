The production value of the digital content industry totaled
NT$341.2 billion (US$10.37 billion) in 2006, up 17 percent from
the previous year, according to Industrial Development Bureau
Director-General Chen Chao-yih.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, the production value of games software surpassed
NT$20 billion for the first time, representing a 10 percent
increase over the previous year, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks when he presided over an award-presentation
ceremony Tuesday for the winners of a digital content competition
that took place last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of the competition was to induce creativity
and turn that creativity into products and upgraded production
values.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the competition, now in its fifth year,
will serve as a platform between digital content businesses and
schools so as to introduce school talent to the digital content
industry.

<P>
Minister without Portfolio Lin Feng-ching said the government had
originally set the production value of Taiwan's digital content
at a projected NT$600 billion by 2010, but he added that given
the performance of the digital content industry last year, the
future development of the industry could be even more stunning.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the main difference between the digital content
industry and the manufacturing industry lies in creativity,
saying that future development will center on animation and
games, in the hope of making inroads into the international
market through TV and film animation.
</P>
<P>
The government has in recent years put a great deal of effort
into the digital content industry as part of its "two-trillion,
twin-star" program. "Two trillion" refers to the production
values of the semiconductor and imaging display panel sectors
reaching NT$1 trillion each while 'twin star" refers to digital
content and biotechnology industries.
