CABINET APPROVES 10-YEAR PLAN FOR CRAFTING LONG-TERM CARE SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA) 02/07/07  12:30:34 (By Sofia Wu)

The government will spend more than NT$76.8 billion (US$2.31
billion) developing a long-term care system over the next decade
to deal with the challenges created by the greying of the local
population,  Minister-without-Portfolio  Lin Wan-yi said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been incorporated into the "Mega Warmth" social
welfare project with an aim of offering long-term care aid to
elderly people who require assistance with daily activities,
physically and mentally challenged people over 50 years of age,
indigenous people aged over 55, and disabled elderly people who
live alone, Lin explained.
</P>
<P>
It will be the largest social welfare program after the national
pension system, Lin said, adding that low-income families will
receive full subsidies if needed under the long-term care
program, while middle-low-income families will receive a 90
percent subsidy and regular families will be entitled to a 60
percent subsidy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that long-term care includes a variety of both medical and
non-medical services for the elderly and people with disabilities
or chronic illnesses, Lin said the ambitious program is expected
to create some 60,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official tallies, Lin said that the local population is
steadily greying, with seniors accounting for 10 percent of the
country's total population this year. "This means more than 2.26
million people over 65 years of age, with more than 200,000 of
them needing different levels of long-term care or assistance,"
he added..
</P>
<P>
By 2016, Lin said, seniors will make up over 13 percent of the
total population. "By that point, the ratio of people aged under
14 will begin to decline, while the elderly population will
continue to increase, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Changing demographics will make the need for crafting a long-term
care system even more critical than ever, Lin said, adding that
what the elderly need most is medical care, social care and
economic security.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Lin said, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands have
introduced long-term care insurance systems to pay for long-term
care services for the elderly. Most other countries are using tax
money to finance elderly welfare services.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the government will refer to Japan's 1994 "New Golden
Plan" in forging a comprehensive long-term care system for the
elderly over the next decade.
