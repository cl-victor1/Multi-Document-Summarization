The Ophthalmological Society of Taiwan is calling on eye doctors
to join a nationwide campaign to provide free eye care to elderly
people who live by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Pan Chih-chin, chairman of the society, quoted a study by the
Cabinet-level Department of Health saying that 38 percent of old
people troubled by eye disease are inclined to develop symptoms
of depression -- about three times that of healthy old people.
</P>
<P>
He added that eye ailments are not just physical problems but
also psychological problems, and that the problems are even more
serious among old people who live alone.
</P>
<P>
Pan said the Ophthalmological Society of Taiwan is inviting more
eye doctors to become "ambassadors" in the campaign to locate
elderly people living alone with eye disease and offer them free
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is being supported by the pharmaceutical company
Alcon. Some 300 old people living alone in one Taipei community
received free eye care Tuesday and heard lectures on how to keep
their eyes healthy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the society has provided free eye care to
more than 2,000 people since 2005.
