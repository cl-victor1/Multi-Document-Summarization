The Taipei International Book Exhibition 2007 lowered the curtain
Sunday after drawing more than 400,000 visitors in six days, its
leading organizer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rex How, chief of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation which organized
the annual gala, dismissed the decline in the number of visitors
this year as insignificant, attributing it to the fact that this
year's exhibition took place in the leadup to the Chinese New
Year Day when local people are busy with ushering in the new year
and it concurred with the national academic performance
examinations for senior high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
However, How claimed the exhibition has developed into an
regional event which distinguishes it from book fairs in Beijing
which cater mainly to publishers and book fairs in Hong Kong
which aim at promoting sells of books.
</P>
<P>
In addition to publishing companies in Japan and South Korea that
debuted in the exhibition last year, How said, publishing firms
in Southeast Asia were invited to display their books in the
exhibition this year,  a move aimed to reflect the country's
increasing immigrants from that region.
</P>
<P>
How whose term as chief of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation ended
with the close of the 2007 exhibition said he was glad the book
fair has put the island on the map of international publishing
business.
