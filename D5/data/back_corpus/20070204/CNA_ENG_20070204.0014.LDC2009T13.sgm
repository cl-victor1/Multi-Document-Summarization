Former President Lee Teng-hui has reassured worried supporters he
met with Sunday morning to clarify recent controversial remarks
he made concerning Taiwan's national goals, said the head of a
group supportive of Lee after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The 'Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association' will not disband and
will continue to throw strong support behind Lee, Hwang Kun-hu,
President of the association told the press after Lee addressed
cadres of the group and its pro-independence allies in the Taiwan
Solidarity Union and Taiwan Society.
</P>
<P>
Hwang said Lee's insistence on Taiwan's sovereignty in his talk
with the participants in the breakfast meeting, held at a
Kaohsiung City hotel, has relieved them of their doubts and
anxieties.
</P>
<P>
Only cadres from eight out of the association's 21 local branches
attended the meeting amid rumors that several branches were to
disband due to disappointment with Lee, long dubbedthe godfather
of Taiwan independence, who was quoted in Next Magazine in late
January as saying that he has never advocated Taiwan
independence.
</P>
<P>
Lee thereafter clarified his stance through a TV interview and a
newspaper advertisement, saying that Taiwan already has de facto
independence and therefore no longer needs to pursue it. He also
reiterated that Taiwan needs to rectify its name, craft a new
constitution, seek membership in the United Nations and become a
normal country.
</P>
<P>
However, his remarks still angered and disaffected some of his
most enthusiastic allies and supporters. Lee Shiao-feng, a
historian prominent for advocating Taiwan's national identity,
said Saturday he decided to vacate his committee seat with the
Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association.  He said while  Lee's
explanation  about  Taiwan independence may be acceptable,  he
cannot stand thecomplete confusion of valuesapparent as Lee
accuses President Chen Shui-bian as corrupt while praising the
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Jing-jeou as clean.
</P>
<P>
Political commentator Chin Heng-wei also said the same day he
would resign from the board of Taiwan Advocates, a think tank
funded by Lee Teng-hui, while Chet Yang, secretary-general of the
Taiwan Society said many members of the society required sleeping
pills or anti-hypertensive drugs to calm down following Lee's
comments.
</P>
<P>
Hwang, however, said Sunday that while there are various opinions
being expressed across the political spectrum these days, the
'Lee's Friends' Association' will remain firmly in place.
