APPLYING TO JOIN U.N. UNDER NAME OF 'TAIWAN' SET POLICY: MOFA

Taipei, May 30 (CNA) 05/30/07  18:40:50 (By Deborah Kuo)

Seeking to join the United Nations as a full member  under the
name of "Taiwan" is a set policy of the administration and will
not change, Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Tzu-pao said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the remarks at the legislative Diplomacy and Overseas
Compatriot Affairs Committee, in which opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) legislators grilled him over whether the government is
still planning to apply to join the U.N. as a full member under
the name of "Taiwan" after suffering a setback in its attempt to
apply for accession into the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
full member under the name of "Taiwan" earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator John Chiang asked Yang whether the administration
will still go ahead with the country's U.N. bid this September
using the title "Taiwan membership" as used earlier this month in
Taiwan's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
Discounting the appropriateness of the term "Taiwan membership, "
KMT Legislator Lee Chi-chu pointed out that "Taiwan" is not the
formal name of the country, which she claimed is why not all of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies voted "yes" for the cause of Taiwan
during the World Health Assembly meeting May 14.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Lee's criticism, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim said that the term or title Taiwan
uses in its bid to join the WHO or the U.N. is not the issue. The
problem, she said, lies in the fact that the country's sovereign
status is not recognized in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said she supports the administration's use of "Taiwan" in
its WHO and U.N. bids because "Taiwan" is a name already fully
recognized and accepted by people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Hsiao's opinions, Yang said failure to recognize Taiwan's
sovereignty is the main cause behind the country's failure to
facilitate its WHO and U.N. bids.
</P>
<P>
Describing the WHO and U.N. bids under the name of "Taiwan" as
"ramming one's head against a wall, " Chiang said he will
initiate a motion at the Legislative Yuan to bring charges
against President Chen Shui-bian for violating the Constitution
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yang said during the committee meeting that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will investigate why only 17 of
Taiwan's 24 diplomatic allies cast votes in favor of Taiwan in
the WHA vote May 14.
