The legislature resolved Tuesday to call for fewer hours for the
country's thousands of resident doctors.
</P>
<P>
In the non-binding resolution sponsored by 28 lawmakers from the
opposition Kuomintang, the legislature asked the Department of
Health to work out measures to help reduce the workload on
resident doctors.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Lai Shy-bao, the chief sponsor of the resolution, said
Taiwan resident doctors work between 100 hours and 120 hours per
week compared to 80 hours per week for their U.S. counterparts
and 40 hours per week for ordinary office clerks.

<P>
Citing a survey conducted by his office staff, Lai said local
resident doctors have to stay in hospital for night duty every
three days and have to work a full day shift after the night
duty.
</P>
<P>
These unusually longer hours have a heavy impact on doctors'
performance and constitute a risk for their patients, Lai noted,
citing a U. S. survey that found doctors undertaking a 90-hour
workweek are 50 percent more likely to commit errors on the job,
and 22 percent more likely to commit serious mistakes.
</P>
<P>
In order to raise the quality of local medical services, Lai
urged the health authorities to reduce the working hours of
resident doctors, who have to face the punishing hours in a six-
to seven-year training period necessary before he or she can be
promoted to the rank of doctor in charge.
