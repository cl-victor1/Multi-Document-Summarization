Taipei,  May  30  (CNA) 05/30/07  15:47:03 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The ROC Military Academy (ROCMA) is investigating an alleged
sexual assault by a cadet of the United States Military Academy
at West Point who is in Taiwan on an exchange program at the
ROCMA, Ministry of National Defense officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the matter during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
National Defense Committee, Vice Minister of National Defense Lin
Chen-yi said the case is still under investigation as there are
discrepancies in the statements by the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
If the West Point cadet is determined to have committed a crime,
he will have to face the law in Taiwan, Lin said, adding that the
case will not affect Taiwan-U.S. exchanges.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Yi-ping, deputy chief of the general staff for
personnel,  a West Point officer who is leading the exchange
delegation to Taiwan is assisting the ROCMA in looking into the
case.
</P>
<P>
The American Institute in Taiwan has been informed and asked to
help handle the matter, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page report published Wednesday by the United Daily
News, a female Taiwanese undergraduate accused a West Point cadet
of bringing her to a hotel in Tainan City and having sex with her
without her consent when she was "half drunk" last week.
</P>
<P>
The woman said she was introduced to the West Point cadet in a
pub in Tainan City last Friday night by a friend studying at the
ROCMA, identified by his surname as Chuang, who was in charge of
receiving the West Point cadet during his stay in Taiwan for a
short-term exchange program at the ROCMA.
</P>
<P>
The woman claimed that Chuang and the West Point cadet kept
encouraging her to drink and that they brought her out of the pub
soon after midnight, when she had become "half drunk" after
consuming about three bottles of beer.
</P>
<P>
Chuang then left her with the West Point cadet, who later brought
her to the city's Evergreen Laurel Hotel, the woman said.
</P>
<P>
As they entered the hotel room, the cadet began stripping off her
clothes, the woman claimed, adding that he then engaged in sexual
intercourse with her before she "even had a chance to resist" as
she was not fully conscious due to the effects of the alcohol she
had consumed, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Lin Hsieh-hsiang, the ROCMA's political warfare
chief, said Chuang has been referred to the academy's
disciplinary committee for punishment for visiting an "indecent
hangout."
</P>
<P>
The offense is punishable by at least one major demerit, Lin
said.
</P>
<P>
As to how West Point is going to deal with the concerned cadet,
the ROCMA will respect any decision made by West Point, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin confirmed the academy received the woman's phone call Sunday
in which she complained  that Chuang  had not fulfilled  his
responsibility of protecting her after inviting her to the pub.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the woman and Chuang were classmates during
elementary school, and Chuang introduced her to the West Point
cadet because she had previously indicated her intention of
making friends with foreign students.
</P>
<P>
Chuang claimed he had no idea where the woman and the West Point
cadet were going after he left them that night, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that the case is an isolated incident, which he said
will not affect future exchange programs between the ROCMA and
West Point.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "unfactual" the woman's claim that ROCMA cadets
have often organized such "indecent" activities for visiting West
Point cadets.
