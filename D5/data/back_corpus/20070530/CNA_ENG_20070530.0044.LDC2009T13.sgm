Premier Chang Chun-hsiung urged the U.S. Congress Wednesday to
continue its generous support for Taiwan's bid to join the World
Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Chang made the appeal while receiving a delegation organized by
the Congressional  Black Caucus,  an organization  representing
African-American members of the U.S. Congress.

Noting that stable Taiwan-U.S. relations are instrumental to
regional peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Chang said he
is hopeful that both countries can forge even closer and smoother
dialogue channels for their administrative and legislative
branches to facilitate bilateral cooperation in various fields.

Members of the U.S. congressional delegation, including Rep. G.K.
Butterfield and Rep. Donna M. Christensen, said they are
impressed by Taiwan's progress in various fields. They also
promised to continue through their weight behind Taiwan's WHO
bid.
