EMPLOYMENT LIMIT FOR FOREIGN WORKERS MAY BE EXTENDED TO 9 YEARS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 30 (CNA) 05/30/07  18:47:55 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan finished Wednesday a preliminary review of a
proposed law amendment that would extend the employment limit for
foreign workers from the present six years to nine years.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment to the Employment and Services Law, which was
adopted by the Legislative Committee on Health, the Environment
and Social Welfare, is a compromised version of an earlier
proposal that advocated lifting the limit altogether, which met
strong opposition from the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).
</P>
<P>
According to CLA Deputy Chairwoman Tsao Ai-lan, removing the
employment time limit for foreign workers would have a social and
economic impact on Taiwan and increase the personnel costs of
their employers.
</P>
<P>
For example, Tsao said, the government would not be able to
forbid the spouses and children of such workers from visiting
Taiwan for family reunions.
</P>
<P>
If the foreign workers were to give birth in Taiwan, the
government would have to allow their children to reside in
Taiwan, Tsao continued, adding that the issue also involves other
"problems" such as foreign workers' right to claim retirement
pensions, their children's right to education and their right to
health care.
</P>
<P>
Tsao noted that with the exception of Canada, where there is a
vast territory and a small population size, other countries such
as South Korea and Singapore have all set limits on the
employment period of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
Although extending the employment duration to nine years would
help employers save training costs, such a long employment
duration could undermine the physical and mental health of
foreign workers, especially women, Tsao claimed.
</P>
<P>
Tsai further claimed that there are precedents in which foreign
workers developed physical or mental disorders after separating
for a long period of time from their spouses and children, adding
that extending the employment duration would also squeeze the
rights of Taiwanese workers.
