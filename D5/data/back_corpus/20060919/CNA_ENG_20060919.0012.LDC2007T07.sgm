TAIWAN, LIBYA FORGE COOPERATIVE TIES TO PROMOTE BILATERAL TRADE

Taipei,  Sept. 19 (CNA) (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's trade promotion organization has signed an agreement with
Libya's foreign trade authorities on joint efforts to reinforce mutual
investment and boost trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative agreement was forged by Ali A. Isawi, head of the
Libyan Export Promotion Center, and Chao Yun-chuan, secretary-general
of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA), in Taipei City Monday.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA is planning to organize a trade delegation for a visit to
Africa in December to seek to boost trade with countries there,
including Libya, where the council has attended two trade fairs in the
capital Tripoli since 2005, according to TAITRA officials.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian visited Libya May 10, when he revealed that
Taiwan will make efforts to strengthen its relationship with the oil-
rich country in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Libya -- the second largest oil producer in Africa -- has a population
of 6.09 million people and a per capita income of US$8,400, the
highest level in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Libya's foreign trade has grown quickly since the United Nations and
the United States lifted in 2004 economic sanctions on the nation once
accused of committing acts of state-sponsored terrorism. Thanks to
high international oil prices, Libya's foreign reserves have grown by
leaps and bounds in recent years. It has also become one of the most
popular emerging markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
In January, President Chen met with Saif Qadhafi, son of Libyan leader
Muammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi, in Taipei. During the meeting, they
exchanged views on issues concerning cooperation in the areas of trade
and economics, technology, aviation, tourism and military security.
</P>
<P>
During Chen's stopover in Libya in May, the two sides signed a
memorandum of understanding on exchanging representative offices as
part of efforts to reinforce their bilateral relationship.
