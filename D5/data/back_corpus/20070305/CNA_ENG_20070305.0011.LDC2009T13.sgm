'FOUR WANTS' MAY IMPACT U.S.-TAIWAN-CHINA RELATIONS: SPEAKER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  12:37:08 (By Deborah Kuo)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that the new
"four wants and one without" doctrine on Taiwan's status spelled
out by President Chen Shui-bian the day before may further strain
the already tense cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
The new doctrine -- namely Taiwan wants independence, a new
constitution, further development, and a change to the country's
official designation, and there is no polarization of Taiwan into
right and left wings -- may also have an impact on Taiwan's
relations with the United States, Wang said during a brief
interview with news media at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that he has no idea why the president put forth the new
doctrine but that he is sure the remarks will send a new ripple
of uncertainty through the domestic political arena as well as
the triangular U.S.-Taiwan-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while making an address at a dinner party
held in Taipei Sunday to celebrate the 25th founding anniversary
of the Washington-based Formosan Association for Public Affairs
(FAPA) , a non-profit organization promoting Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that Taiwan is a sovereign state independent of
China and that independence is a common goal of the Taiwan
people. He said 'Taiwan' is the best name to be used in the
country's bid to join the United Nations and other international
organizations. He further said that in order to become a normal
and complete state, Taiwan needs a new constitution that suits
the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen also explained that there is no problem of leftist or
rightist policy lines but only a problem of national identity and
the question of whether to unify with China or secure Taiwan's
formal independence.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000 inaugural address, Chen made his "five noes" pledge,
namely that as long as Beijing has no intention of using military
force against Taiwan, he will not declare independence, not
change Taiwan's name, not add the state-to-state theory to the
Constitution, not promote a referendum on the independence versus
unification issue, and not abolish the National Unification
Guidelines and the National Unification Council.
