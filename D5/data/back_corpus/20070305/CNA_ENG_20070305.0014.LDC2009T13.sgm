Soaking in water at 40 degrees Celsius may be uncomfortable for
many people, but larval Japanese tree frogs take great pleasure
in swimming in steamy hot springs at more than 50 C.
</P>
<P>
Among the hundreds of tadpole species, only larval Japanese tree
frogs enjoy taking spa baths, a local expert on amphibians said.

<P>
In this period between late winter and early spring, more than
100 larval Japanese tree frogs have been found swimming in steamy
Lisung Hot Spring located over 1,000 meters above sea level in
Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan which can be reached via
the Southern Cross-Island Highway, also known as Taiwan Highway
20, and which is one of southern Taiwan's major tourist
attractions.

Chao Jen-fang, an assistant professor at Minghsin University of
Technology, said that of the 30-plus types of frogs commonly seen
in Taiwan, the Japanese tree frog, or Hyla japonica, is the only
amphibian species that can breed in hot water.

"Despite its name, the Japanese tree frog doesn't seem to like to
live in trees," Chao said, adding that it prefers residing in
stream beds, particularly hot springs.
</P>
<P>
Among Taitung's hot springs located in wilderness areas, the
Lisung Hot Spring is the only one where "spa frogs" have been
found. In a neighboring freezing stream, a kind of black tadpole
can only survive in water at three or four degrees Celsius.
"Viewing such a sharp contrast, I'm amazed by the wonders of
Mother Nature, " Chao said.
