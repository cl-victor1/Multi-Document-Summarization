President Chen Shui-bian lit up the main lantern Sunday at a
ceremony in Taipao, Chiayi County in southern Taiwan to mark the
opening of the 2007 Taiwan Lantern Festival exhibition.

The centerpiece of the exhibition is a Taiwan boar standing
18-meters tall, weighing 20 metric tons and able to rotate 360
degrees.

Addressing the ceremony, Chen said Taiwan boar embodies Taiwan's
vitality and resilience, while the can-do spirit of Chiayi
County, known as Chuloushan in ancient times also symbolizes
Taiwan's people fighting spirit that will propel Taiwan to pursue
continued progress and advancement.

The Lantern Festival, which fell on Sunday this year, was
celebrated throughout the country. The festivities in Taiwan
Sunday marked the last day of the 15-day Chinese New Year
celebration.

In Yenshui, Tainan County, a 13-kilometer string of firecrackers
was lit up, hoping to create the world's longest firecracker in a
record-setting attempt expected to last two hours. More than
100,000 people swarmed to the southern Taiwan rural township to
witness the setting off of the firecrackers, dubbed the "Fire
Dragon Legend."
