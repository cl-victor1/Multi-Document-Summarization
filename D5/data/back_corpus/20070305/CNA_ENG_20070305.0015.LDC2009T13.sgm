JITTERY SELL-OFF PERIODS USUALLY GOOD TIME TO BUY: ECONOMIST

Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  16:41:50 (By Deborah Kuo)

When investors make panic sell-offs as a result of political
events,  those periods usually make good opportunities to buy, an
economist with a private think-tank said Monday.

Commenting on the nosedive of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX)
Monday -- by a disastrous 3.74 percent or 285.59 points -- Gung
Ming-hsin, vice president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said that judging from past experience, "political bad
news" usually provides a golden opportunity for investors to buy
cheaply.
</P>
<P>
Gung predicted that given the healthy fundamentals of Taiwan's
economy, buyers would greatly outnumber sellers Tuesday should
the TAIEX witness another slump.
</P>
<P>
The TAIEX dropped nearly 300 points Monday, following a nosedive
of 265 points March 1, partly as a result of the spelling out of
a new "four wants, one without" doctrine by President Chen Shui-
bian the day before, including that Taiwan wants independence.
</P>
<P>
Gung said it usually takes a long time before any declared
political policies are actually put into force.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the TAIEX slide was also caused by other
factors, including a jittery U.S. stock market as a result of
last week's global equities sell-off and Chinese Premier Weng
Jiabao's remarks made earlier in the day that Beijing will take
more measures this year to restrain domestic investment and loan
activities in order to cool off the overheated Chinese economy.
