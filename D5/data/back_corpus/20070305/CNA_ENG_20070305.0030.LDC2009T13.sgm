The Taipei-based Far East Air Transport Co. (FEAT) announced
Monday that it will serve the route between Taipei and Hangzhou
in China's coastal Zhejiang province via Jeju in South Korea
beginning April 20.
</P>
<P>
According to a FEAT spokesman, the Taipei-Jeju-Hangzhou route,
which will be served by daily flights, will save passengers two
to three hours in travel time without transferring at Hong Kong
or Macau.
</P>
<P>
The aviation company currently flies from Taipei to Shanghai,
Shenyang and Beijing via Jeju due to a lack of direct air links
between Taiwan and China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Affected by an ailing domestic air travel market, Taiwan-based
carriers are keen to explore business opportunities in the
Chinese market, but have to detour to a third country or area as
a result of the ban on direct shipping and air flights across the
Taiwan Strait.
