TAIWAN'S CHINA POLICY AIMED AT CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: MAC OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  16:54:16 (By Luis Huang)

An official with the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
reiterated Monday that pursuing everlasting peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait has always been the ultimate goal of the
government's cross-strait policy.
</P>
<P>
Under this premise, the government will continue to step up
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges based upon its implemented measures
and give top priority to promoting cross-strait tourist exchanges
and direct charter flight services, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official further said that since both sides of the Taiwan
Strait have reached a consensus on the tourism and charter flight
issues, the government will seek to complete bilateral
negotiations in order to substantiate a full opening of Taiwan to
Chinese tourist visits as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian
declared a new "four wants and one without" doctrine a day
earlier, saying  Taiwan  wants independence,  name-rectification,
a new constitution, and further development.
</P>
<P>
Chen spelled out the new doctrine while addressing a dinner party
held in Taipei Sunday to celebrate the 25th founding anniversary
of the Washington-based Formosan Association for Public Affairs
(FAPA) , a non-profit organization promoting Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
The president  claimed  that Taiwan is a sovereign  state
independent of China and that independence is a common goal of
the Taiwan people. He said "Taiwan" is the best name to be used
in the country's bid to join the United Nations and other
international organizations. He further said that in order to
become a normal and complete state, Taiwan needs a new
constitution that suits the country.
