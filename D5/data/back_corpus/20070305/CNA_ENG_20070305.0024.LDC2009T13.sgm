PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE MUM ON TREASON CHARGES AGAINST PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 5 (CNA) 03/05/07  19:28:13 (By Maubo Chang)

The Presidential Office refused to comment Monday after a group
of opposition lawmakers filed a lawsuit against President Chen
Shui-bian, accusing him of treason.
</P>
<P>
Opposition People First Party (PFP) legislators Fu Kuen-chi, Feng
Ting-kuo, Liu Wen-hsiung and Lee Fu-tien filed the complaint with
the Taiwan High Court Prosecutor's Office earlier that day
accusing Chen of treason for saying the previous day that Taiwan
should seek permanent independence and needs a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The PFP lawmakers argued in their complaint that the president
has betrayed his official oath to faithfully perform his duty as
head of the Republic of China by seeking to overthrow the ROC,
which constitutes the crime of treason.
</P>
<P>
Since the president is immune from all criminal pursuit except
for the crimes of treason  and rebellion  according  to the
Constitution, the lawmakers argued that the Prosecutor's Office
should subpoena the president for questioning.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the president is helping China by replacing the
words "China" or "Chinese" in the names of several state-run
enterprises with "Taiwan" and "Taiwanese" because this is in line
with China's denial of the existence of the ROC.
