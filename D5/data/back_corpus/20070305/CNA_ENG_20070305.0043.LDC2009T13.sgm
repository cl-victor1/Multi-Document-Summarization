Taiwan and China may proceed as soon as possible to work out
measures to deal with exchanges of their currencies, Liu Te-hsun,
vice chairman of the Cabinet- level Mainland Affairs Council,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks when asked to comment on a statement by Wu
Xiaoling, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, two days
ago that Taiwan's attitude is pivotal to the proposed currency
exchange, and that if Taiwan agrees, the two sides could begin
negotiations on the technicalities and related matters.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that a mechanism is needed for the liquidation of each
other's currency to facilitate the conversions of China's
currency, the renminbi yuan, and the New Taiwan dollar.
</P>
<P>
He added that the matter could not be determined by either side
unilaterally and must be worked out through negotiations between
those government agencies on both sides in charge of foreign
exchange affairs.
</P>
<P>
To meet short-term needs of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan who
carry only the Chinese currency, the government will work out
interim measures to allow each person to exchange a limited
amount of Chinese yuan into New Taiwan dollars, Liu said.
