Four pet shop owners in Chiayi, southern Taiwan were taken into
custody Wednesday for trafficking rare birds listed as animals
entitled to special protection under the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna
(CITES) agreement.
</P>
<P>
Police with the Chiayi operation  of the National  Police
Administration's Forestry Bureau apprehended the four people
after raiding their shops, where 203 rare birds of 13 species
from overseas were discovered.
</P>
<P>
Of the birds, two were orange-winged Amazon parrots each worth
over NT$30,000 in street value on the Taiwan pet market, the
Chiayi forestry police said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 201 CITES-protected birds included small skylarks,
Java sparrows, rainbow lorikeet, garrulax canorus,  Madagascar
lovebirds, yellow-fronted canaries and grey singing finches, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
The raid was part of efforts under an operation named "An Kang"
aimed at keeping smuggled wildlife, particularly wild birds, at
bay during winter time, the peak time for the spread of avian
flu, the police said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that some of 1,000-odd gracular religiosa that were
seized in Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan in 2005 were found to
be carrying the virulent avian flu H5N1. Those birds were killed
before they were landed in Taiwan, they added.
