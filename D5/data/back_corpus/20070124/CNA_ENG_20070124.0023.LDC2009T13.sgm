President Chen Shui-bian visited Jiji township in Nantou County,
central Taiwan Wednesday, accompanied by Minister of National
Defense Lee Jye and Water Resources Agency (WRA) officials,  to
inspect the process  of dredging  work on the Jhuoshueihsi river,
Taiwan's longest river.
</P>
<P>
Chen toured the Jiji section of the river after receiving a
briefing from Col. Tai Ying-chie, who commands an engineering
corps commissioned to assist in the operation, which is part of
the government's overall river regulation efforts in flood-prone
areas.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his respect for the military personnel carrying
out the work.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is prone of typhoon devastation due to its geographic
position, with the number of tropical storms hitting the island
reaching 3.5 per year on average, Chen said, noting that the
storms can cause serious flooding.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Nantou County, surrounded by mountains and
fields, has been more heavily damaged by typhoons than other
counties, Chen said, stressing the importance of the anti-flood
efforts.
