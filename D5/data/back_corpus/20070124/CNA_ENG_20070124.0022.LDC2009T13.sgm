TAIWAN RESEARCHERS SEQUENCE DNA OF BUTTERFLY ORCHIDS

Taipei,  Jan.  24  (CNA) 01/24/07  17:29:41 (By Zep Hu)

Taiwan agricultural researchers have completed the DNA sequencing
of 56 out of 60 non-hybrid butterfly orchid species worldwide,
facilitating future research, breeding and identification,
Council of Agriculture (COA) officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The COA's Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and Extension
Station has spent three years and some NT$2 million (USD$60,500)
on the project, sorting the orchids' DNA and establishing the
first orchid DNA database in the world.
</P>
<P>
The findings have been published by the science journal Plant
Systematics and Evolution and the DNA datasets have also been
added to the database at the U.S. National Institute of Health.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Chi-chu, an associate research fellow at the station,
explained that each butterfly orchid carries its unique DNA
sequence and that even after several generations of
hybridization, the extraction of the "descendants" can still be
recognized by its genetic expressions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, with the help of such a database, researchers can now
easily identify "who" the orchid is and "where" it comes from, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Making examples of two seemingly identical species in Taiwan,
Tsai said that the phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana and
phalaenopsis amabilis var. formosana are extremely similar in
appearance, often causing unnecessary confusion in research and
breeding.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we can tell aphrodite from amabilis by a simple DNA test,"
he said.
