Tokyo,   Jan.   24  (CNA) 01/24/07  13:05:01 (By Yang Ming-chu

<P>
China's  anti-satellite  technology development has posed a
threat to other countries including Taiwan, which deserves the
concern of the international community, a Taiwan official said in
the Japanese capital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks while giving a speech at Japan's Foreign Correspondents'
Club, referring to China's recent anti-satellite weapons test in
which a ground-based missile was used to destroy an old
satellite.
</P>
<P>
Wu said it is based on such concern over China's military
modernization that Taiwan has been calling for an international
arms embargo against China.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was pleased to see Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urge
leaders of European countries to reaffirm their commitment to
maintain the European Union's arms embargo against China during
his recent visit to Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
While China has never eased its military intimidation against
Taiwan since the 1996 cross-Taiwan Strait missile crisis,
military reports released by the United States show that China
has deployed nearly 900 short- and medium-range missiles
targeting Taiwan and is developing submarines equipped with
state-of-the-art facilities, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern that China's military buildup will upset the
military balance across the strait and change the cross-strait
status quo.
</P>
<P>
In addition to stepping up its military threat against Taiwan,
Beijing has continued its efforts to isolate Taiwan, using
checkbook diplomacy in Africa to woo Taiwan's diplomatic allies
away and blocking Taiwan's efforts to take part in international
organizations such as the United Nations and the World Health
Organization, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the future development of relations between Taiwan and China,
Wu said Taiwan will never accept China's "one country, two
systems" formula for unification, which is now being practiced in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should learn a lesson from
the example of Hong Kong, which has seen its freedom suppressed
by Beijing since its handover from Britain to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that the majority of people in Taiwan wish to
maintain the status quo and have no desire for unification with
China because they want to lead a life of freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that there will not be any major changes in the
current policy even if the pro-unification Kuomintang wins the
next presidential election in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Taiwan is worried about possible suppression by China at
the 2008 Olympic Games to be held in Beijing, Wu said Taiwan
faces such problems very often and needs the help of the
international community in upholding fairness and justice for the
country.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that if the 2008 Olympic torch relay is to include
Taiwan, the torch must be passed from a third country to Taiwan
instead of directly from a Chinese territory, because Taiwan,
unlike Hong Kong and Macau, is not part of China.
