TAIWAN TO ENACT REFUGEE LAW
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Jan. 24 (CNA) 01/24/07  11:57:51 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan will review a draft bill on refugees at its
last weekly meeting before the Chinese New Year, which falls on
Feb. 18 this year, a senior official in charge of mainland
affairs said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said
the draft bill, co-authored by the Ministry of the Interior and
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if enacted, will apply to
persecuted people from all over the world, including those from
China, Hong Kong and Macau as well as all other countries.
</P>
<P>
Once the bill is formally enacted with the Legislative Yuan's
approval, You said, those who were persecuted in their homeland
or who have a well-founded fear of persecution there for
political, religious or ethnic reasons can apply to Taiwanese
authorities for refugee status and asylum.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a party to the U.N.-sponsored Convention
Relating to the Status of Refugees adopted in 1951, You said, the
government is determined to enact a refugee law to deliver on its
promise of promoting a rights-based national development approach
and making human rights protection its core value and top guiding
principle.
</P>
<P>
In drafting the law, You said, the Interior Ministry and Foreign
Affairs Ministry referred to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and
other globally accepted norms and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan is expected to approve the draft bill after a
thorough review at its Feb. 14 weekly meeting, You said, adding
that the bill will then be referred to the legislature for
deliberation and final approval.
</P>
<P>
After the bill takes effect, You said, foreigners as well as
Chinese, Hong Kong and Macau citizens who fall victim to
persecution on account of race,  religion or political  opinion
can file applications with the Ministry of the Interior for
refugee status.
</P>
<P>
If the applicants are certified as refugees through due process
set forth in the law, You said, they can then apply for asylum or
settlement.
</P>
<P>
As to whether having Chinese, Hong Kong and Macau citizens
subject to the same refugee law as foreigners would ignite a new
round of debate on the divisive "independence vs. unification"
issue, You said that is not the government's main concern.
</P>
<P>
"The key consideration in enacting a refugee law lies in the
belief in the inextricable and interdependent link between human
rights and development," You said.
</P>
<P>
Given that human rights define and defend human well-being, You
added that a rights-based approach to development provides both
the conceptual and practical framework for the realization of
human rights through development process.
</P>
<P>
"By enacting  a refugee  law,  we'll show the world  our
determination to shoulder more international duties and make our
human rights protection standards on par with global norms, " You
added.
