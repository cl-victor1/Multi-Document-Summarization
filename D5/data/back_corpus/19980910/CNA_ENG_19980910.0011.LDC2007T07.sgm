Taipei,  Sept.  10 (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
The Taipei-based China Development Corp. (CDC), which has the ruling
Kuomintang as its major shareholder, is planning to establish the
first development bank in Vietnam, CDC sources reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan is saturated with venture capital operations, the CDC is
shifting its attention to overseas markets, prompting it to establish
a development bank in Vietnam with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and the Vietnamese government as major partners.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials said CDC, whose pre-tax profit target this year is
NT$10.1 billion (US$293 million), has recently obtained preliminary
approval for the project from the Vietnamese prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Although Hanoi has currently frozen the licensing of new banks, it is
giving its full support to the establishment of the first development
bank in Vietnam, CDC officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will require the CDC to provide US$50 million of the
projected US$100 million capitalization for the development bank. The
CDC will hold 50 percent of the bank's shares, while the rest of the
capitalization will be shared by Vietnam's state-owned enterprises and
the ADB.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the proposed bank is expected to kick off in the
fourth quarter of this year, CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
They admitted that overseas investments, like the one involving the
Vietnamese bank, bears higher risks than similar operations at home.
Such high-risk opportunities are worthwhile because of the higher rate
of investment return, they said, adding that the annual return rate
for the development bank is expected to top 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to CDC tallies, currently 109 Taiwan firms are engaged in
venture capital business with an overall investment capital totaling
NT$62.6 billion (US$1.8 billion).
</P>
<P>
In related news, CDC officials announced that the company has
successfully raised NT$10 billion (US$290 million) as of Wednesday
from 20 major shareholders of the proposed Southeast Asian Investment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian Investment Corp., expected to be a powerful
investment arm in Southeast Asia, will initially target Thailand and
the Philippines, said the CDC officials.
