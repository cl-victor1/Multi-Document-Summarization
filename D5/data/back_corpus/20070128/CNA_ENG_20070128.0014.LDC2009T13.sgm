A local association dedicated to promoting Hakka culture and
language was inaugurated Saturday, with President Chen Shui-bian
and other government officials attending the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Chen said in his opening remarks that he was pleased to see the
establishment of the new civic organization, which he said would
help defend Taiwan's sovereignty and promote Taiwanese identity.

Major DPP bigwigs, including Premier Su Tseng-chang, ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and
former Premier Frank Hsieh, were also present at the occasion.

Delivering his address in Hakka, Su said he began to learn the
language during his term as Pingtung county magistrate. Su
explained that he started Hakka lessons after attending a village
meeting where some Hakka seniors complained about his inability
to speak Hakka.

<P>
The southern county has a Hakka population of more than 200,000,
which accounts for one-fifth of the county's total population.

<P>
Yu, for his part, said in Hakka that he is Hakka, yet cannot
speak the language very well. He said the DPP government has
dedicated itself to raising the awareness of Hakka culture since
taking power in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Now Hakka music and culture have entered the mainstream market,
according to Yu.

Hsieh described the Hakka people as "outstanding" and expressed
hope that everyone can help promote Hakka culture.
