HEALTH AUTHORITIES APPROVE USE OF AQUAMID INJECTABLE IMPLANTS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan.  28 (CNA) 01/28/07  19:22:41 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The Cabinet-level Department of Health has formally approved the
use of Aquamid injectable implants as a safe non-invasive method
for cosmetic operations --  a move widely acclaimed by Taiwan's
plastic surgeons.
</P>
<P>
Liang Wei-chung, a plastic surgeon who runs a cosmetic clinic in
Taipei, told reporters Sunday that Aquamid --  a transparent,
injectable implant in hydrogel form composed of 97.5 percent
sterile water bound to 2.5 percent cross-linked polymers -- can
be used like Restylane to correct facial defects, but its effects
can last three to 10 years -- longer than the eight months to one
year for Restylane.
</P>
<P>
Liang added, however, that Aquamid is expensive  at about
NT$35,000 per c.c.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 countries  have approved the use of Aquamid
injectable implants and at least 100,000 people have used the
method to improve their quality of life and self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that although the method is safe and does not require
surgery, general anaesthesia or hospitalization, those who want
to make use of Aquamid implants to improve their looks should go
to qualified and experienced doctors because it is important that
the correct amounts of hydrogel be administered.
</P>
<P>
He said the hydrogel implants are ideal for treating wrinkles and
augmenting the mouth, lips or cheeks because they are non-
resorbable, non-toxic and non- allergenic, and do not disappear
or move from the injection site.
