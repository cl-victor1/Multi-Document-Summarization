ADVICE, CRITICISM DRIVING FORCE BEHIND REFORMS: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 28 (CNA) 01/28/07  15:54:25 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that advice and criticism
have been the driving force enabling Taiwan's democratization
and reforms to continue during the period of democratic
transition.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that over the past six years, he has pushed for an
open, fair, free and neutral media environment in Taiwan, while
building an impartial supervisory mechanism to govern it.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a ceremony in which he conferred, on
behalf of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, the 2006 Asia
Democracy and Human Rights Award on Robert Menard, founder and
secretary-general of Reporters Without Borders (RWB), in
recognition of the association's commitment to serving the public
interest and its global efforts to defend press freedom.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, he said, Taiwan advanced to a world ranking of 43rd in
the global freedom of the press index, up eight notches from the
51st position in 2005 and leading Japan's 51st place and the
United States' 53rd place.
</P>
<P>
As one of the true democracies in Asia, Taiwan should treasure
its hard-earned fruits of democracy and its freedom of the press,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that presently about one-third of the world's population
live in countries or areas where there is no press freedom. In
Asia in particular, there are still some countries where the
media is suppressed and news reporting censored, he said.
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, there are still many people in China sentenced to
death on charges of leaking national intelligence simply because
they have defended the truth of the news.
</P>
<P>
As of today, he added, more than 130 journalists from around the
world have been imprisoned simply for doing what they are paid to
do -- keeping the people informed. A majority of them are in
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Imprisoning or killing a journalist is like eliminating a key
witness and threatens everyone's right to be informed, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of the Asia Democracy and Human Rights
Award in 2006 represents Taiwan's commitment and responsibility
to pushing for democratization in the international community.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Taiwan's insistence on the values of democracy
and freedom and their implementation has had positive clout in
the international community," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy conferred the 2006
Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award on the France-based RWB
after many world renowned human rights specialists, including
Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, made recommendations and after fair,
independent screening by a panel of judges.
</P>
<P>
It reflects the fact that RWB is held in high esteem for its
efforts to promote freedom of the press and media in Asia, Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the association has been fighting for human rights and
democratic values, as well as defending freedom of expression and
ensuring the protection of journalists by denouncing human rights
breaches. "It has also made extraordinary contributions to Asia
in terms of deepening and consolidating democratization," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Menard traveled to Taipei Friday to receive the award in person.
</P>
<P>
Before  arriving  in Taipei,  Menard said it is extremely
significant for him and the RWB that officials from the
association were invited to visit China and to receive an
important award from Taiwan within a single week.
</P>
<P>
It reflects the fact that the RWB's clout and the values that the
RWB has insisted on have also been recognized in Chinese-speaking
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Menard said the prize money that comes with the award will be
used to finance the establishment of a new RWB Web site in
Chinese aimed at allowing more Chinese-speaking people to enjoy
the benefits of freedom of the press and to be better informed.
</P>
<P>
RWB is kept on constant alert via its network of over 100
correspondents and rigorously condemns any attack on press
freedom around the world by keeping the media and the general
public informed through press releases and public- awareness
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The association defends journalists and other media professionals
who have been imprisoned or persecuted for doing their work. It
speaks out against the abuse and torture of journalists that is
still common practice in many countries.
</P>
<P>
It supports journalists who are being threatened in their own
countries and provides financial and other types of support to
their families.
</P>
<P>
The association is also fighting to reduce the use of censorship
and to oppose laws designed to restrict press freedom and working
to improve the safety of journalists worldwide, particularly in
war zones.
