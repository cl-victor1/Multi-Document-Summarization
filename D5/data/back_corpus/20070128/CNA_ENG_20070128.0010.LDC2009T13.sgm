Taipei,  Jan.  28 (CNA) 01/28/07  16:43:13 (By Luis Huang)

Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD) Chairman Wang Jin-pyng
called Sunday for the Beijing leadership to put democracy into
practice as soon as possible while dedicating itself to economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who also serves as speaker of the Legislative Yuan, made
the appeal while addressing a TFD award presentation ceremony
during which President Chen Shui- bian conferred the 2006 Asia
Democracy and Human Rights Award on Paris-based Reporters Without
Borders Secretary-General Robert Menard.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over Chinese restriction of press freedom and
its worsening human rights record, Wang said Beijing's leaders
should accelerate the country's democratization pace since a
China with no democracy and freedom will bring disaster to the
world, despite its brisk economic development.
</P>
<P>
If a nation  only focuses  on modernization  and economic
development, this is not correct administrative policy, Wang
said, adding that the leadership  should seek to enrich the
people spiritually and culturally while striving for economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Citing the first-ever "World Map of Happiness" produced by Adrian
White,  an analytic social psychologist  at the University of
Leicester, and released in July 2006, Wang pointed out that
Bhutan ranked eighth globally in terms of happiness, far better
than the rankings of Japan and Taiwan, although its per capita
national income stood at just US$1,400.
</P>
<P>
Wang claimed that Bhutan would "rather not seek economic growth,"
thus side- stepping the socio-environmental imbalance problem
caused by economic development.
