Taiwan's first tilting train, the "Taroko Express," made its
debut Tuesday in Hualien, eastern Taiwan, carrying passengers on
a smooth and speedy railway trip to Taipei in less than two
hours.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yung-cheng, an official in charge of train operations at the
Taiwan Railway Administration's (TRA's) Hualien Station, said
proudly that the new train is the fastest on the east coast
railway line, even when it runs as a non-express train.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the launch of the "Taroko Express, " the traveling time
between Taipei and Hualien was about three hours. The tilting
train can run at a speed of 20-25 km per hour faster on curves
than any of the traditional trains, cutting the travel time by
over an hour, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The TRA has spent NT$2.8 billion (US$84.84 million) for the new
trains in efforts to address the problem of time-consuming land
transportation between Taipei and the eastern county which is
separated by mountains from the economically-flourishing west.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Tuesday, the "Taroko Express" will run three times a
day between Taipei and Hualien, with an extra run on holidays,
according to the TRA.
