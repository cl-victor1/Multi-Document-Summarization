MA PROMISES TO RESTORE MUTUAL TRUST WITH U.S. IF ELECTED
PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  8 (CNA) 05/08/07  22:46:47 (By Han Nai-kuo)

Ma Ying-jeou, a former chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), said Tuesday that if the KMT is returned to power in the
2008 presidential election, it will work to rebuild the mutual
trust between Taiwan the United States.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of students from the Warton School of Business
of the University of Pennsylvania who were visiting National
Taiwan University, Ma, the KMT's nominee for the 2008
presidential election, promised that if he is elected, the KMT
government under his leadership will not be a "troublemaker" in
the international community.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ma added, Taiwan will continue to buy sophisticated
weapons from the United States and maintain a good cooperative
relationship with the U.S. in military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ma described the 12 years from 1988 to 1999 under President Lee
Teng-hui as Taiwan's "golden age" in terms of its relations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
That period saw 24 rounds of negotiations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait and visits to more than 10 countries with no
diplomatic ties with Taiwan by the nation's president and vice
president, as well as visits to Taiwan by cabinet ministers from
these countries, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economic strength then allowed it to purchase the arms
it needed to ensure Taiwan's security, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, from 2000 until the present while the Democratic
Progressive Party has been in power, not only has cross-strait
dialogue ceased but the economy has become stagnant, Ma said,
adding that the period has also brought a series of "surprises"
for U.S.-Taiwan relations.
</P>
<P>
He gave his assurance that if the KMT is returned to power, it
will work to restore a stable relationship with the United
States.
