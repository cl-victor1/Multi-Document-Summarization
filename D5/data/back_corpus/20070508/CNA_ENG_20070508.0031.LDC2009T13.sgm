The state-run CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC) announced Tuesday that it
will cut gasoline prices by NT$1 per liter and the price of
diesel by the same amount at midnight the same day.
</P>
<P>
The price adjustment was made according to the CPC floating oil-
pricing mechanism, which calculated that there was a 5.16 percent
drop in the prices of West Texas Intermediate crude traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange over the past week.
</P>
<P>
With the adjustment, the price of 92 octane unleaded gasoline
will fall to NT$26.3 per liter, while that of 95 octane unleaded
gasoline will be NT$27 per liter, and 98 octane unleaded will be
NT$28.5, the CPC said.

<P>
The price of regular diesel will fall to NT$23.1 per liter, while
that of super diesel will be NT$23.6 per liter, while fuel oil
price will drop to NT$16,393 per kiloliter.
</P>
<P>
The CPC began to implement a floating price system for oil Jan. 3
to better reflect the company's costs. The pricing system is
based on fluctuations in the price of West Texas Intermediate
crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
