The Taiwan-El Salvador-Honduras Free Trade Agreement (FTA) ,
established Monday by the three countries, is expected to boost
Taiwan's trade, investment and technological cooperative ties
with the two Central American nations, an official with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The trilateral agreement will increase trade opportunities for
entrepreneurs  in the three states and create jobs for their
respective citizens, the official said,  adding that Taiwanese
manufacturers can also make inroads into the North American
market by taking advantage of the Central America-Dominican
Republic- United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR).

<P>
On behalf of the government, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve
R.L. Chen inked the agreement with Salvadoran Economics Minister
Yolanda de Gavidia and Honduran Minister of Industry and Commerce
Lizzy Azcona at a signing ceremony in the Salvadoran capital of
San Salvador, which was witnessed by presidents of the two
Central American states, according to the official.

<P>
Once the FTA comes into force, El Salvador and Honduras will
offer immediate duty-free treatment to 57 percent and 61.9
percent of Taiwan-made products exported to their respective
markets, while 64.4 percent of Salvadoran commodities and 69.4
percent of Honduran goods will enjoy similar treatment when
exported to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This is the third FTA Taiwan has signed with its diplomatic
allies in Central America. Prior to the trilateral agreement,
Taiwan signed separate FTAs with Panama, Guatemala and Nicaragua,
and it is seeking to begin FTA talks with the Dominican Republic
and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, bilateral trade between Taiwan
and El Salvador was valued at US$80.48 million for 2006, with
Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$62.5 million, while the
value of Taiwan-Honduras trade amounted to US$50.16, with Taiwan
enjoying a US$21.43 million trade surplus.
