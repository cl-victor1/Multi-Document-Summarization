FABRICATION

Taipei, May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  19:59:07 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
A local cable TV station said Tuesday that it might press libel
charges against a newspaper that alleged it of fabricating news.
</P>
<P>
Sanlih E Television (SET TV) issued the statement after the
United Daily News claimed earlier in the day that film footage
used in the television company's special report to mark the 60th
anniversary of the 228 Incident showed "anachronistic lapses."
</P>
<P>
In the special report aired between March 3 and March 7, the
station introduces the background of the incident and describes
the local disturbances and ensuing brutal government crackdown.
There are also interviews with scholars, family members of the
victims, reconstructions by actors and a small number of clips of
documentary footage and photos.
</P>
<P>
At issue was a 20-second clip showing troops shooting people at
close range in the street, but the newspaper reports pointed out
that the footage shows Kuomintang troops executing businessmen
accused of hoarding and members of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) in Shanghai during the heat of a civil war between the KMT
and the CPC in 1948, or one year after the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, SET TV used the footage several times
in the program with a subtitle that read "a chronicle of street
killing at Keelung harbor."
</P>
<P>
Chen Ya-lin, a senior anchorwoman for the special report, argued
that the subtitle of the film footage made no mention that it was
shot during the 228 Incident.
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk through the whole program. The showing of the
footage was mainly to project the image of massacre and there was
no intention to mislead," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
She said the footage was supplied by the Juan Chao-jih Memorial
Hall on a tape titled "A Chronicle of the Tragic 228 Incident."
</P>
<P>
Juan Chao-jih, former head of a local newspaper, was among
thousands killed in 1947 in the 228 Incident. His daughter helped
set up a memorial hall in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, that closed
last year due to insufficient manpower.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei Film Archive officials said that among the
government files, there are no film clips about the 228 Incident
and noted that even photographs documenting the tragic chapter in
Taiwan's history are rare.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  the National Communications Commission said the
television company's handling the film clip failed to follow the
professional standard procedures of correct journalism.
</P>
<P>
NCC Vice Chairman Howard Shyr said the commission will turn over
related evidence to an NCC committee for scrutiny and that it
will take appropriate action.
