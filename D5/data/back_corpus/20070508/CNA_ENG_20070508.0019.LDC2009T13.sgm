Washington,  May 7 (CNA) 05/08/07  16:34:38 (By Michelle Tsai and
Luis Huang)

California Hospital Association (CHA) President C. Duane Dauner
called Monday for the World Health Organization (WHO) to grant
membership to Taiwan, saying that like other countries, Taiwan is
entitled to become a full member of the international health
body.
</P>
<P>
Dauner made the remarks while speaking at a dinner party hosted
by Taiwan's representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, to
honor California hospital superintendents and chief executive
officers from local medical organizations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's medical treatment system is worthy of study
by other countries, Dauner said that the CHA is looking forward
to boosting cooperative relations with Taiwan and that the
organization will throw its support behind the country's bid to
join the WHO.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wu told his guests that China has spared no efforts
to obstruct Taiwan's WHO bids over the past years, adding that
this year,  President  Chen Shui-bian  has sent a letter  to WHO
Director-General Margaret Chan expressing Taiwan's desire to
become a WHO full member under the name of "Taiwan. "
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a recent public opinion survey, 94.7
percent of the respondents expressed their support for the new
approach to bidding for WHO membership, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Citing Taiwan's recent assistance to Sao Tome and Principe in the
African country's  fight against malaria,  Wu said Taiwan has
participated  actively in international  humanitarian assistance
efforts, and as such should be admitted into the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) , the
WHO's decision- making arm, as an observer since 1997, but has
seen little progress due to China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
At the WHA gathering last year, Taiwan's hopes of joining the
organization were dashed for the 10th consecutive year when the
WHA General Committee decided not to include Taiwan's bid on the
assembly's agenda.
</P>
<P>
This year, Taiwan has decided to apply for full WHO membership
under the name of "Taiwan, " in addition to continuing its
efforts to gain observer status in the WHA. The annual WHA
conference is scheduled to open May 14 in Geneva.
