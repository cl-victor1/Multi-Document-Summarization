Taipei,  May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  21:56:13 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei blamed the Executive Yuan
Tuesday for the failure to have its 2007 budget bill clear the
Legislative Yuan, while Premier Su Tseng-chang met with 10 of the
country's 25 mayors and magistrates to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Chou, who did not appear at the meeting, expressed doubt as to
whether the talks will help the bill's passage and questioned the
premier's reluctance to communicate with opposition legislators
who have been blocking the budget bill as a way to protest
against what they claim is the government's unyielding attitude
toward the KMT's pushing for legislation of a proposed draft bill
concerning the organization of the Central Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chou said his county is now in serious financial straits because
of the delay of the budget bill's passage. If the Legislative
Yuan fails to adopt the bill by the end of the current
legislative session, the Taipei county government will have to
borrow money to maintain its operations this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chou urged the government to resolve the differences between the
ruling and opposition parties in order to make sure the budget,
which concerns the welfare of everyone, clears the legislature as
soon as possible.
