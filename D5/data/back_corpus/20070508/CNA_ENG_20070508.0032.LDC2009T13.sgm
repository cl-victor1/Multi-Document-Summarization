The Kaohsiung city government will set up a new sports agency to
help with the preparations for the 2009 World Games to be hosted
by the southern Taiwan port city, Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Cheng
Wen-lung said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently the preparatory work for the World Games is handled by
the Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC) for the 2009 World Games
-- a civic organization funded by the Kaohsiung city government
-- and assisted by officials from the city government's Bureau of
Education and personnel from the Kaohsiung Municipal Stadium.

<P>
Cheng said that the city government  will combine related
operations of the Bureau of Education and the municipal stadium
to form a sports agency in July.
</P>
<P>
The new agency will work with the KOC and help coordinate various
affairs for the World Games, including the recruitment of
volunteers, organization of the work force, and promotional work
for both the World Games and the city of Kaohsiung.

<P>
The 2009 World Games, scheduled for July 16-26, 2009, is the
first major global sports event to be hosted by a city in Taiwan
in 60 years. Some 3,200 athletes from more than 90 countries are
expected to compete in 28 sports categories.
</P>
<P>
The main stadium  for the World  Games,  currently  under
construction, is scheduled for completion in January 2009.

Covering an area of 19 hectares, the stadium will cost N$5
billion (US$150.6 million). It will have a world-class track and
field facilities and the seating capacity to accommodate 55,000
people.

The stadium  has been designed  to be the world's  first
multifunctional stadium powered by solar energy. Its solar power
generators will be capable of supplying 1 million kilowatts of
electricity a year.
