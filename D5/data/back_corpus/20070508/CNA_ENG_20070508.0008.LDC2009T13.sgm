New York,  May 7 (CNA) 05/08/07  14:01:08 (By Jaw-pyng Hwang and

Taiwan-born New York Yankees star pitcher Chien-Ming Wang, fresh
from being included as a "Hero &amp; Pioneer" in Time Magazine's
"List of 100" most influential persons, pitched for a different
game for his native country Monday.
</P>
<P>
As a spokesman for the World Games 2009 Kaohsiung, Wang appeared
at a news conference held at Taiwan's representative office in
New York City -- the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO),
where he delivered his pitch for the international sporting event
to be held in Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan July 16-26, 2009.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was organized by the Kaohsiung Organizing
Committee (KOC) to present the World Games 2009 to the U.S.
media, with KOC Chief Executive Dr. Chen I-heng presiding.
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, Ron Froehlich, president of the
International World Games Association (IWGA) , put a hat bearing
the Kaohsiung World Games logo on Wang's head to mark the start
of a half-year contract for Wang to serve as the event's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he feels honored to be given the job to speak for the
international sporting event to be held in his home country. "It
offers me a one-of-a-kind experience in my life, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Froehlich  said the IWGA --  the World Games'  sponsoring
organization -- highly welcomes Wang's pitch for the Kaohsiung
World Games and hopes the sporting event will be held smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who came close to pitching a perfect game against the
Seattle Mariners last Saturday, was the star attraction at the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd of Wang's fans swarmed to the TECO office to get a
glimpse of their idol. Many of them scrambled to ask for Wang's
autograph after the ceremony, causing a commotion at the
otherwise quiet and tidy TECO office.
</P>
<P>
The event also attracted the largest-ever number of media
professionals since the TECO moved to its present location more
than two years ago, TECO staff members said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to reporters from Chinese and foreign-language media
outlets, the New York Yankees also sent a sports columnist and
and photographers to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
Wang won 19 games for his team last year and was the runner-up
for the coveted Cy Young Award. Earlier this year, Wang was
featured as a tango dancer in the promotional reel for the World
Games 2009 Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 6,000 athletes from around the world are expected to
take part in the World Games 2009 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second
largest city which is also home to the country's top commercial
harbor.
</P>
<P>
The 2009 World Games will feature 26 non-Olympic sports, plus six
invitational demonstration sports, to be held at 23 stadiums in
Kaohsiung City and neighboring Kaohsiung County.
