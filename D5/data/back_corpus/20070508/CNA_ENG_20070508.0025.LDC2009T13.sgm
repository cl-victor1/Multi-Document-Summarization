Only 18 percent to 20 percent of the production equipment used by
Taiwanese solar cell manufacturers is "made-in-Taiwan", but the
government has vowed to raise that to 50 percent by 2009, a
senior officials at the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced
Tuesday during a review of Taiwan solar energy industry.

Meanwhile, according to the ministry, the government has provided
incentives bringing NT$2.84 billion (about US$85 million) of
foreign and domestic investments to the industry so far, as well
as patent and technology transfers worth NT$ 47.3 million.

Officials noted that goals in next stages include increasing the
conversion efficiency of silicon-based solar cells from etween 15
percent and 17 percent to 18 percent and 20 percent, and lowering
the cost per kilowatt of silicon-based cells from US$3 to US$2,
as well as developing and refining other advanced products,
particularly in terms of greater efficiency and lower cost.

<P>
In an estimate issued by the Industrial Technology Research
Institute, the production value of made-in-Taiwan solar cells has
already increased from US$2.8 billion in 2004 to US$21.2 billion
in 2006.
