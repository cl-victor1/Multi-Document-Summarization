A huge nanmu tree snapped into two near the roots Tuesday in the
Chipen Forest Recreation Area in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan,
falling and causing one death and another injury.
</P>
<P>
Forestry Bureau officials said the tree, which was so large that
three adults holding hands were required to embrace the trunk,
had grown on hollow roots that could no longer support the solid
trunk.
</P>
<P>
The deceased, identified as Hsu Chin-shuei, 54, was struck by the
falling trunk while taking a relaxing stroll in the scenic forest
area early this morning, while Liu Feng-chin, 51, was injured in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The two were part of an over-200-member tour group composed of
Kingcar Industrial Co. staff and their family members from the
northern county of Taoyuan. The group arrived in the national
forest the previous night for a sightseeing trip.

Hsu and Liu were rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors failed
to save Hsu from his severe injuries. Liu, much more luckier, was
diagnosed as suffering from a moderate brain concussion. Liu
recalled that she was hit by tree branches before she had a
chance to notice anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
Liu's husband said that there was no wind at the time of the
incident, nor any rainfall. There were no indications that such a
deadly tree fall was eminent, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
The tree, more than 100 years old, was more than 20 meters tall
and overgrown by many clinging plants. Its trunk snapped one
meter above the ground, according to the Forest Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Nanmu is a large, slow-growing tree of the evergreen laurel
family that develops with a long straight trunk ranging between
10-40 meters high, and 50 to 100 cm in diameter.
