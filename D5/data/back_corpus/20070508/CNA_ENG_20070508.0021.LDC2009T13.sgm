TAIWAN PROMOTES BID TO JOIN INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  17:15:22 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will promote its bid to join the Indian Ocean Tuna
Commission (IOTC) at the organization's annual conference, which
Taiwan will continue to attend as an "invited expert," a Council
of Agriculture (COA) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IOTC will convene its 11th annual meeting between May 13-18
in Mauritius to discuss the issue of adjusting the IOTC's
relations with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the
United Nations, said Hsieh Ta-wen, director of the Fisheries
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The IOTC is established under the U.N. framework, and therefore
abides by the U.N. rules, which includes referring to Taiwan as
"a Province of the PRC," Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
If the IOTC reaches a resolution to change its relation with the
FAO, Hsieh said, it would facilitate Taiwan's membership bid.
Taiwan is not a U.N. member and has been barred from joining any
U.N.-affiliated bodies due to China's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
As a non-member, Taiwan cannot speak at the IOTC meeting to push
for a change to the IOTC-U.N. relations, and has to instead lobby
IOTC member countries to initiate a proposal at the meeting to
separate the IOTC from the FAO, Hsieh said, adding that some
countries, however, still doubt the merits of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has managed to join nearly all major oceanic organizations
except the IOTC because of its ties with the FAO, Hsieh noted.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Hsieh said that Taiwan will apply for the IOTC
membership as a "fishing entity."
