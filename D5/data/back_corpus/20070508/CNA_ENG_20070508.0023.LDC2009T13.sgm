Taipei,  May 8 (CNA) 05/08/07  17:37:18 (By T.C. Jiang)

<P>
A total of 14 mayors and magistrates from around the country
issued a joint statement Tuesday urging the Legislative Yuan to
pass the 2007 budget bill for the central government as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Premier Su Tseng-chang invited 25 heads
of city and county governments to the Executive Yuan to discuss
the budget issue.
</P>
<P>
Su said that all the 25 cities and counties are "in the same
boat, " and that competition among political parties should
benefit the nation and the people instead of hindering national
development.
</P>
<P>
Su said he hopes that the regional heads could lobby locally
elected legislators to pass the long-stalled budget bill.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 mayors and magistrates were present at the meeting,
while others sent representatives on their behalf, Cabinet
spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said.
</P>
<P>
Some cities and counties did not sign on the joint statement
because their representatives were not authorized to do so, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair read aloud the statement at a press
conference after the meeting, stressing that the central
government budget has a deep impact on the development of local
economy.
</P>
<P>
Hsu also urged legislators of different political stripes to put
aside their political differences to complete the screening of
the budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Over NT$51.1 billion (US$1.5 billion) in the 2007 government
budget is earmarked for local governments.
