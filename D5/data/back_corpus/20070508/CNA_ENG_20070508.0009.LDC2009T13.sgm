KAOHSIUNG WORLD GAMES TO FOLLOW OLYMPIC NORMS: ORGANIZERS
</HEADLINE>

New York,  May 7 (CNA) 05/08/07  14:29:19 (By Jaw-pyng Hwang and
Sofia Wu)

The World Games 2009 Kaohsiung will follow the norms set in the
Olympic Games in dealing with the flag and anthem issues if China
sends athletes to take part in the event, a spokesman for the
Kaohsiung Organizing Committee (KOC) said in New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
KOC Chief Executive Chen I-heng made the remarks at a news
conference held at the Taiwan's representative office in New York
City, officially known as the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office.
</P>
<P>
The KOC organized the news conference in New York City in the
hopes of enhancing U.S. awareness of the largest-ever sporting
event to be held in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China is eligible to take part in the eighth World
Games to be held in Kaohsiung July 16-26, 2009. "We welcome
Chinese athletes to join the event," he added.
</P>
<P>
If Chinese athletes win gold medals, he said, the Chinese
national anthem will be played at the award presentation ceremony
as is the practice at the Olympic Games. If Chinese athletes win
silver or bronze medals, he added, China's national flag will
customarily be hoisted at the presentation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, Ron Froehlich, president of the
International World Games Association (IWGA) , put a hat bearing
the Kaohsiung  World Games logo on the head of Chien-ming  Wang,
Taiwan-born New York Yankees pitcher, to mark the start of a
half-year contract for Wang to serve as the event's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he feels honored to be given the job to speak for the
international sporting event to be held in his home country. "It
offers me a one-of-a-kind experience in my life, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Froehlich  said the IWGA --  the World Games'  sponsoring
organization -- highly welcomes Wang's pitch for the Kaohsiung
World Games and hopes the sporting event will be held smoothly.
He added that politics should never be involved in the sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. media presence fell short of original expectations, but
the presence of Wang to pitch for the Kaohsiung World Games
marked a big success for the publicity drive.
</P>
<P>
Wang, fresh from being included as a "Hero &amp; Pioneer" in Time
Magazine's "List of 100" most influential persons, came close to
pitching a perfect game against the Seattle Mariners last
Saturday. He was the star attraction at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd of Wang's fans swarmed to the TECO office to get a
glimpse of their idol. Many of them scrambled to ask for Wang's
autographs after the ceremony, causing a commotion at the
otherwise quiet and tidy TECO office.
</P>
<P>
The event also attracted the largest-ever number of media
professionals since the TECO moved to its present location more
than two years ago, TECO staff members said. In addition to
reporters from many Chinese-language media outlets, the Star
Ledger, the largest newspaper in New Jersey and several radio
stations also sent reporters.  The New York Yankees sent a sports
columnist and photographers to cover the event.
</P>
<P>
Wang won 19 games for his team last year and was the runner-up
for the coveted Cy Young Award. Earlier this year, Wang was
featured as a tango dancer in the promotional reel for the World
Games 2009 Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 6,000 athletes from around the world are expected to
take part in the World Games 2009 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second
largest city which is also home to the country's top commercial
harbor.
</P>
<P>
The 2009 World Games will feature 26 non-Olympics sports, plus
six invitational demonstration games, to be held at 23 stadiums
in Kaohsiung City and neighboring Kaohsiung County.
