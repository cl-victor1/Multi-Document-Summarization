DPP CHALLENGES KMT TO SUBSTANTIATE ACCUSATIONS OF BUYING TV TIME
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  23  (CNA) 04/23/07  18:23:14 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
challenged the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday to come up with
evidence to substantiate its claims that the DPP presidential
hopefuls are "buying" TV news reports.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wang Tuoh, secretary of the DPP Legislative Caucus, said
lies cannot be turned into truth by simply repeating them and
that the KMT, which claims three of the four DPP presidential
aspirants have offered money to local TV channels in exchange for
news coverage of their election campaign, should verify their
accusation with evidence or keep quite.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the source of the accusation was accredited to Yang
Tu, director of the KMT's Cultural and Communications Committee,
Wang said Yang is the last person who should make the accusation
because he himself was financed by Ma Ying-jeou to film a
documentary of the 228 Incident about a revolt by the Taiwanese
against the KMT regime in 1947, with the purpose of whitewashing
KMT's role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The film was shot in 2004 when Ma served as mayor of Taipei and
before Yang was named the chief of the cultural committee.
</P>
<P>
Yang was quoted by Monday's United Daily News as saying that
among the DPP presidential hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Su Cheng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- all except Lu have bought TV news
coverage through proxies.
</P>
<P>
Yang condemned the three DPP hopefuls for infringing on the
ethics of journalism and perhaps breaching the law regulating
political donations.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted Ba Jien, a manager of the Formosa
Television Company Ltd. as saying that politicians are likely to
ask for more news coverage while placing their political TV
commercials, and that his station is willing to offer KMT
politicians the same treatment if they buy commercials from
Formosa TV.
</P>
<P>
Based on Yang's claims, KMT lawmaker Ting Shou-chung asked the
National Communications Commission Monday to stem the placement
of TV advertisements featuring politicians during the election
campaign period.
