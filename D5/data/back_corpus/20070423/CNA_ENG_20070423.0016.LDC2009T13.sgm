The National Teachers' Association said Monday that teachers can
make unruly students stand so that "they can reflect upon their
wrongs."
</P>
<P>
The association issued the clarification after the Apple Daily, a
local tabloid, reported that the Ministry of Education will soon
publish guidelines for teachers counselling or disciplining
students. One claim by the paper was that teachers, when
disciplining students, would need their consent.
</P>
<P>
The teachers will also not be able to demand students to do
pushups or frog jumps if the purpose is to punish the students,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yi-feng, an association official, said that in the future,
there will be no such thing as a "disciplinary stand" and that
the teachers will only require students "stand to reflect upon
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Since the purpose is for the students to reflect upon themselves,
the teachers will not need to obtain the students' consent, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan approved a total ban on corporal punishment
last December. An attached resolution also asked the Ministry of
Education and the National Teachers' Association  to work out
guidelines on campus discipline.
</P>
<P>
The association said that after discussions over the last four
months, it has mapped out details of the guidelines.
