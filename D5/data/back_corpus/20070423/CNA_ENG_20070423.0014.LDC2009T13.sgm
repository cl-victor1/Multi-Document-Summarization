The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that if
there is evidence to support vote buying allegations in the
party's upcoming legislative primary, the party will deal with
them harshly.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung made the remarks amid reports
that the approval ratings for 19 legislative aspirants vying for
the at-large seats are close and that the competition is fierce.
They will be ensured a berth in the year-end streamlined
legislature if they can garner 20,000 votes in the member vote
May 6. As such, rumors have it that one ballot is selling for
NT$3,000 (US$90.9).
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that the party has a task force charged with cracking
down on vote- buying and that it is probing the rumors, but he
also urged the media and the aspirants to refrain from
"insinuations" and "exaggerating" election corruption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Yu Cheng-dao urged the party to get to
the bottom of the vote-buying rumors, while his colleague Gao
Jyh-peng said that if there are no cash rewards or interference
by the government, it will be difficult for the party alone to
track down vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
The new legislature will be elected through a "single-seat
constituency, two ballots" system instead of the existing "single
vote, multiple-seat constituency" system. Voters will cast two
ballots, one for the constituency and another for their favored
political party.
</P>
<P>
The 225-seat legislature will also be halved to 113 members, with
73 seats elected from regional districts, six seats for
aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for at-large and overseas
expatriate representatives.
</P>
<P>
The regional seats will be distributed  among the special
municipalities, counties and cities according to their
populations, with each locality enjoying at least one seat and
one legislator elected from each district. The at-large and
overseas expatriate seats will be allocated to political parties
that win at least 5 percent of the votes cast, according to the
proportion of votes they garner.
