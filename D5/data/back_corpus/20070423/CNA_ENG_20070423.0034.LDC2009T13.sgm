CITY COUNCILORS CRITICIZE KAOHSIUNG ZOO FOR MALFUNCTIONS
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung, April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  21:57:59 (By Y.C. Jou)

Kaohsiung municipal Shou Shan Zoo was fiercely criticized by
several councilors during a city council question period Monday
for what they called poor management, a lack of professionalism
and inhumane treatment of animals.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) city councilor Lien Li-jen
dressed himself like an orangutan to express concern for the
mental condition of zoo orangutan that always hides itself and
appears to be afraid of people.
</P>
<P>
Lien said many animals in the zoo display abnormal behavior, are
in poor health and appear solitary or aggressive.
</P>
<P>
The zoo acts against the global trend in promoting animal
welfare, Lien said, suggesting that the zoo, which he describes
as poorly-funded and dysfunctional, be closed.
</P>
<P>
Hung Fu-feng, head of the city government's Economic Affairs
Bureau (EAB) , which oversees the zoo, said the bureau will draft
a plan to reform the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier  this month,  a crocodile  in the zoo bit off a
veterinarian's left forearm while the vet was attempting to
remove anesthetic needles from it. DPP councilor Lee Wen-liang
demanded that the EAB clarify responsibilities  over the incident
and take disciplinary actions accordingly.
</P>
<P>
He also asked that bureau raise the amount of danger pay for zoo
staff.
</P>
<P>
The male crocodile that attacked the vet was, for 10 years,
regarded by the zoo as a Nile crocodile, but after the high-
profile incident drew experts' attention was found to be a
saltwater crocodile, to the zoo's embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
In a similar story, a female elephant resident in the zoo for 28
years was recently reported to have been mistaken as male, though
the zoo officials said an event five years ago to find it
awifewas just a PR activity.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuomintang (KMT) councilor Mei Tzai-hsing called the
"mistake" unforgivable, saying the zoo was inhumane in failing,
for decades, to find it a male companion.
