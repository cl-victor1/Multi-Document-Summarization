PRESIDENT REMAINS NEUTRAL ON DPP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 23 (CNA) 04/23/07  18:56:54 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday he believes that President
Chen Shui-bian is neutral on the four contenders bidding to
represent the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the
2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks in an interview with CNA amid reports that
Chen is throwing his weight behind Su in the hotly contested
primary.
</P>
<P>
To the best of his knowledge, Su said, Chen has so far kept an
"appropriate and congruent distance from each hopeful" in his
capacity as the country's head of state and the party's most
important figure.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen has maintained his noble status as the country's
head of state and is unlikely to express his personal preference
regarding the candidacy choice at the moment, " Su said.
</P>
<P>
In the DPP primary fray, Su's political rivals have questioned
his loyalty toward Chen during last year's "red-shirt" campaign
aimed at forcing Chen to step down over corruption allegations
and Su's handling of a controversial plan to build an expressway
linking the eastern county of Hualien to Suao in the northeastern
county of Yilan.
</P>
<P>
On those two cases, Chen offered prompt and detailed explanations
favorable to Su, which led to speculation that Chen backs Su.
</P>
<P>
Su described the speculation as meaningless. "Chen stood up
mainly because he was personally involved in those issues and was
in the best position to clarify misunderstandings," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Su went on, there tends to be good faith between the
president and the premier. "Without the president's trust, a
premier can't do anything," he said.
