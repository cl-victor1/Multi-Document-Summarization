The Executive Yuan passed a draft bill on a national pension
program Wednesday in a bid to strengthen the nation's social
security net to cover the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said that under the draft bill,
which will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for screening and
approval, uninsured persons can start to pay monthly premiums of
NT$622 for 40 years, or more than NT$290,000 in total, and then
claim five-fold that amount, or more than NT$1.55 million.
</P>
<P>
The bill will cover those aged 25-65 who are currently not paying
military, civil servant, teacher or labor insurance, as well as
farmers under 65. It is estimated that 3.53 million will be
included in the national pension program.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill also calls for the integration of four current
monthly allowances -- the NT$3,000 monthly allowance for seniors,
the NT$5,999 for elderly farmers, the NT$3,000 for aboriginal
seniors and the NT$6,000 for seniors in low-income households.
After the implementation of the national pension program, the
four categories of allowances will be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said the national pension program was one
of the major policies pronounced by President Chen Shui-bian when
he was first elected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The program will be crucial to implementing just and secure
society and the realization of a long-term dream of social
welfare organizations, the premier added.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill, the premium will be 6 percent in the first
year, with a hike of 0.5 percent starting from the third year.
There will be an increase of 0.5 percent every two years after
that until a ceiling of 10 percent is reached. If the outstanding
fund will be able to pay for insurance for the next 20 years, the
premium will not be raised.
