The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has resolved to
host a national rally in September as part of its efforts to push
the country's bid to join the United Nations under the name of
"Taiwan, " DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the resolution, introduced by DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, was adopted at a weekly meeting of the DPP Central
Standing Committee, and the planned rally is scheduled to be held
prior to the opening of the U.N. annual conference.
</P>
<P>
The rally will highlight the DPP's efforts to promote Taiwan's
entry as a sovereign state into various international
organizations, including the U.N., the International Olympic
Committee and the World Health Organization, Lin noted.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the DPP would welcome the passage of the 2008
Olympic torch through Taiwan on condition that Taiwan's status as
a sovereign country is not undermined as the ruling party is
firmly opposed to China's intention of downgrading the nation's
status to that of its local government.
