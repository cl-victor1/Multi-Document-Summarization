Taiwan's re-establishment of diplomatic ties with Saint Lucia
plays a significant role in the country's efforts to consolidate
its relations with other allies in the East Caribbean region,
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks in an interview with CNA prior to his
departure for Los Angeles, from where he will take a flight back
to Taiwan. Huang arrived in Miami the previous night for a
stopover after concluding a visit to Saint Lucia.
</P>
<P>
Huang signed a joint comunique with his St. Lucian counterpart,
Rufus Bousquet, on the resumption of full diplomatic relations in
the St. Lucian capital of Castries Monday. Taiwan established its
embassy there that same day.
</P>
<P>
With the relationship with the leading country in the region, as
well as its existing ties with Saint Kitts and Nevis and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines, Taiwan has built a solid diplomatic
triangle in the East Caribbean, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that St. Lucia is the largest country with the highest
per-capita income -- over US$4,800 -- in the region. The island
state with its beautiful landscape attracts 800,000 foreign
tourists a year, he added, praising the St. Lucian people's
spirit and efforts in pursuing the country's independence from
British colonization.
</P>
<P>
St. Lucia first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1984,
but switched diplomatic recognition to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Huang also confirmed Taiwan's efforts to seek
diplomatic relations with Suriname in South Africa.
