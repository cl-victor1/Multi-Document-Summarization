LEGISLATURE REJECTS CHUNGHWA POST NAME-CHANGE NOTIFICATION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  16:47:49 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan rejected notification from Taiwan Post Co.
Wednesday of its action in February to change the name of the
state-owned company from Chunghwa Post.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party controlled the voting in the
meeting of the legislative committee of transportation on a
proposal by KMT Legislator Tsao Erh-chung to discard the notice
and advise the Executive Yuan to disallow the name change before
the law regulating postal operations is revised.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue" legislators opposed the Taiwan Post action, which
they claimed to be unlawful, and accused the company of
deliberately ignoring the legislative system. They argued that
the corporation, which was transformed from the government agency
of the Directorate General of Posts in 2003, is named Chunghwa
Post in the existing regulations stipulating the company's
establishment.
</P>
<P>
Before  the  vote,  Vice  Minister  of Transportation  and
Communications Ho Nuan-hsien, who is the acting Taiwan Post
chairman, delivered a report to the legislative committee on the
case, in which he stressed the need for the company to change its
designation to truly reflect the historic significance of postal
operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's  postal  service  was  first  named  Taiwan  Post
Administration when it was founded in 1888 by Liu Ming-chuan, the
first governor of Taiwan, appointed by the Ching Dynasty, Ho
explained.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the company's move to change its designation meets
Company Law. Besides, he added, no rights and interests of the
company's employees and clients have been damaged because of the
name change, which is part of the government's drive to get rid
of Chinese references in the titles of state-run businesses and
add the word "Taiwan" to make them more identifiable with their
country of origin.
