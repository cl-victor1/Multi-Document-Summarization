Sixteen members of the U.S. House Representatives jointly
introduced a bipartisan resolution Tuesday calling for the
cancellation of all restrictions on visits by high-ranking Taiwan
officials, including the president, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised by Rep. Steve Chabot, co-chair of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus, in a hearing focusing on China
affairs in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the bill, the congressmen suggested that the administration
comply with its obligations under the Immigration and Nationality
Technical Corrections Act of 1994, which stipulates that Taiwan's
president or any other high-level officials shall be admitted to
visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
The proposed resolution pinpointed the Taiwan Strait as "one of
the flash points in the world" and indicated that it is essential
for U.S. policy makers to directly communicate with Taiwan's
leaders.
