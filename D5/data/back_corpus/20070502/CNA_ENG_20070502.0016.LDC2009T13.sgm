LEVEL OF MINIMUM WAGE ADJUSTMENT NOT YET FINALIZED: CABINET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  14:51:21 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan has yet to approve the level of the planned
minimum wage adjustment, Cabinet spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen was responding to reports by the Liberty Times, a local
Chinese-language daily, which said that the Cabinet has finalized
the level of the minimum wage increase at 9.09 percent, or
NT$1,440 US$44) per month, to NT$17,280 from the current
NT$15,840, while the level of the minimum hourly wage will be
increased by 43.9 percent to NT$95 from the current NT$66.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the 9.09 percent level was proposed by the Council
for Labor Affairs (CLA) and that Premier Su Tseng-chang has yet
to approve it.
</P>
<P>
The premier's stance is that the Cabinet will only announce the
level of the increase after complementary measures concerning the
minimum wage adjustment are finalized, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan's goal is that the minimum wage adjustment
will be implemented July 1, she added.
</P>
<P>
The CLA recently convened a minimum wage screening committee to
discuss the wage adjustment during which it was decided that the
level of the adjustment should be between 7.5 percent and 9.5
percent in view of the soaring living costs and the fact that the
minimum wage has not been adjusted for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The conference participants settled on the proposed hike after
using the 7.5 percent increase in the consumer price index over
the past decade to decide on a reasonable adjustment.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.7 million low-wage workers are expected to benefit
from the adjustment, the CLA said.
