BIDDING FOR WHO MEMBERSHIP UNDER NAME OF TAIWAN RIGHT PATH: GROUP
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  2 (CNA) 05/02/07  21:05:45 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The government is on the right path in bidding for membership in
the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name of Taiwan,
the head of the Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance in
Taiwan (FMPAT) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shuh-min, president of the organization which has long
advocated Taiwan's entry into the WHO, made the remarks during an
interview with the CNA.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan's first application to join the WHO under the
name of Taiwan was rejected, Wu said that Taiwan must persist and
stick to its guns.
</P>
<P>
A WHO spokesman said late last month that as Taiwan is not a
sovereign state, it is not eligible for membership in a
specialized agency of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also president of the pro-independence Taiwan Society, said
that Taiwan has in the past used the name of "health entity" to
request "meaningful participation' in the WHO as an observer, but
this humble hope has fallen through year after year due to the
obstruction of China.
</P>
<P>
Meaningful participation has been suggested by some countries to
refer to the opportunity for Taiwan to participate in as many
WHO-related meetings as possible. But Taiwan's experts have
always been denied or delayed from attending even the most
technical meetings.
</P>
<P>
"As long as China exists, Taiwan will not be able to meaningfully
participate in the WHO," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the participation in the WHO has been based on the
urgent needs for health, security and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who has traveled to Geneva, Switzerland ever May since 1997
to lobby for support for Taiwan's bid to join the WHA, the
decision-making body of the WHO, said that he'll embark on a
similar journey in a few days for the Taiwan's 11th bid to join
the WHO.
</P>
<P>
"This year is a new start. Whatever the result, I'll express the
will of the 23 million people on Taiwan. This is how a normal and
democratic country expresses its views," he added.
