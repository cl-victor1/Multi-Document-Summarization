President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that it is absolutely
impossible for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to
designate in private a candidate for the 2008 presidential
election or to rig in the party's presidential primary.

While meeting with visiting South Korean Kyungnam University
President Park Jae Kyu and his wife, Chen said that the DPP's
presidential candidate will be singled out in mid-May from among
four presidential hopefuls -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier
Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank
Hsieh.

Describing the four presidential aspirants as superb candidates,
Chen told his guests that the party is proud and confident as any
of the candidates could win the DPP's presidential primary and
well represent the party.

<P>
Touching on bilateral relations between the two nations, Chen
stated that Taiwan is looking forward to signing a free trade
agreement with South Korea, which he said will favor bilateral
trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chen also expressed his gratitude to authorities of Kyungnam
University for having allowed a general assembly of the Vice
President-initiated Democratic Pacific Union to be held on their
campus last year.
