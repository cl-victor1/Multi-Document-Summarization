Taipei, May 2 (CNA) 05/02/07  22:38:00 (By T.C. Jiang)

Taiwan's chief trade negotiator said Wednesday that he is not
pessimistic about the prospect of signing a free trade agreement
between Taiwan and the United States, while adding that Taiwan
must employ a multi-faceted approach to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
John Deng, the head of the newly created Office of Trade
Negotiations, said that Taiwan will continue to lobby the U.S.
government, Congress, and business sector in order to start
negotiations on a bilateral agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-South Korea FTA, which will take effect next January, is
not expected to have an impact on Taiwan within one or two years,
Deng said. "We still have time," he stressed, adding that Taiwan
must take measures to draw more support from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
It remains doubtful whether the World Trade Organization (WTO)
can push for further Doha Round negotiations. As a result, Taiwan
should not put all its hopes in the WTO, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should strive to make the U.S. Congress understand the
progress that Taiwan has made in areas of labor administration,
employment service, and environmental protection, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
These are the issues that the Democratic Party attaches special
importance to, and the party has the majority seats in the
Congress, Deng explained.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has put much efforts into
convincing  Congress that a Taiwan-U.S.  FTA can increase job
opportunities in the U.S., Deng continued.
</P>
<P>
Deng conceded that the U.S. business sector is reluctant to voice
an opinion on a Taiwan-U.S. FTA for fear of provoking China.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Taiwan needs to work hard to persuade Congress and the
business sector to express their support for the FTA to the U.S.
government, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Deng also noted that the U.S. has said many times that it does
not have time to begin new FTA talks as it is engaging in
negotiations with Malaysia and Thailand, and that the FTAs that
the U.S. signed with South Korea, Columbia, and Panama still need
to be approved by Congress.
