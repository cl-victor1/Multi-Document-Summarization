Vice President Annette Lu, who is running in the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's 2008 presidential primary,
encouraged disadvantaged school children Sunday to study hard to
make a difference in their lives.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while presiding over the opening of a "Little
Scholars Educational Camp" at Hsinpu Elementary School in Taoyuan
County as part of her community outreach activities.
</P>
<P>
The camp is part of a project she and Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng jointly initiated to provide more educational
resources to children of impoverished families.
</P>
<P>
In view of a widening digital divide between rich and poor school
children, Lu has invited Wang to launch similar camps around the
country to help disadvantaged children get access to after-school
tutoring free of charge. Such children include: those from
families with low income, those born to foreign espouses and
those from single-parent or aboriginal families, as well as those
raised by their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Lu also attended the inauguration of six associations
supportive of her presidential bid in the northern county where
she once served as magistrate.
