Taitung County Deputy Magistrate Huang Fa-lou was taken into
custody early Sunday on charges of corruption after public
prosecutors with the Taitung District Court interrogated him over
his involvement in a construction contract bid rigging case four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors suspected that Huang had received kickbacks after
bid rigging in the awarding of contracts for construction
projects while he was acting head of Taitung County's Dajen
township in 2003.
</P>
<P>
After searching Huang's home and office, prosecutors brought him
to the Public Prosecutors' Office for questioning regarding his
role in the corruption case.
</P>
<P>
To prevent collusion between Huang and other defendants, and in
view of the fact that the offense carries a minimum sentence of
seven years imprisonment, the court granted the prosecutors'
request to detain Huang.
</P>
<P>
Individuals in 14 of Taitung County's 16 townships have been
under investigation for receiving kickbacks and allowing bid
rigging and bidder collusion in local government procedures for
awarding construction contracts five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Three former heads of the townships of Tungho, Chenkung and
Changbin have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms upon
conviction for corruption by the district court.
