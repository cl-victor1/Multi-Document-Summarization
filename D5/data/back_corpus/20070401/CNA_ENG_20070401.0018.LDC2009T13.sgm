To ensure economic growth in the 21st century, the government
needs to adopt new strategies to grapple with emerging
challenges, such as graying population and degradation of the
environment and the atmosphere, a business celebrity said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (TSMC) -- the world's top contract chip maker -- made the
remarks while delivering a keynote speech titled "Emerging
Challenges to Economic Growth" at the Ketagalan Institute in
Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that market economics were victorious in the 20th
century, as western Europe, Japan, Asia's Four Little Dragons,
China, Russia, and eastern Europe all experienced substantial
economic growth by following in the footsteps of the U.S. in
moving towards market economies.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwan could improve its economic performance by
means of conducting educational and legislative reforms,
bolstering infrastructure development, and promoting cultural,
artistic and moral values.
</P>
<P>
He said that the emerging challenges to economic growth include
depletion of water and other natural resources, the degradation
of the environment, pollution of the atmosphere, the impact from
global economic competition, graying populations, and the
people's high expectations.
