NICARAGUAN FOREIGN MINISTER WELCOME TO VISIT TAIWAN ANYTIME: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 1 (CNA) 04/01/07  21:04:30 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Minister of Foreign Affairs Samuel Santos is welcome
to visit Taipei at his convenience, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Wang Chieh-yeh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after a local newspaper reported earlier in
the day that Santos had canceled his plans to visit Taiwan at the
head of a delegation to discuss feasible bilateral cooperative
projects in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Santos signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with his
Taiwanese counterpart, James Huang, at Managua International
Airport Jan. 11 on bilateral trade and investment cooperation,
with President Chen Shui-bian acting as witness.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, he also announced that he would headed a
delegation of officials and business executives to visit Taiwan
in March to flesh out details on future cooperation. The MOU was
the first diplomatic document Nicaragua has singed with a foreign
government after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega took office a
day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Due to his busy schedule, Santos failed to come to Taiwan in
March. Wang affirmed Sunday that Taiwan will welcome Santos'
visit at any time of his convenience.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taiwan's ambassador to Nicaragua, Hung Ming-ta, said
Santos has rescheduled his Taiwan travel plan to late April.
</P>
<P>
Hung told the CNA correspondent stationed in Panama City by phone
that Santos now plans to depart Managua for Taipei in late April
to deliver on his promise to visit Taiwan. Nevertheless, Hung
said, the exact itinerary of Santos's planned visit has yet to be
finalized.
</P>
<P>
Hung also said the Nicaraguan government has decided in principle
to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan while seeking to
develop commercial ties with China.
</P>
<P>
According to Hung, Ortega has indeed expressed an interest in
forging relations with China. "But Ortega has not used the term
of 'resuming diplomatic ties with China' as claimed by the news
media, " he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan respects Nicaragua's foreign policy, Hung said
Taiwan would be pleased to see Nicaragua develop commercial ties
with other countries, including China. "We would not oppose our
diplomatic allies forging unofficial or non-diplomatic links with
China, " he added.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the Nicaraguan presidential election last year,
Hung recalled that Ortega's Sandinista party had indeed
considered "resuming" diplomatic ties with China if it returned
to power.
</P>
<P>
Through his assiduous efforts, Hung said he managed to meet with
Ortega three times before the latter's inauguration, including a
meeting held at his home, and obtained Ortega's verbal promise to
maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hung said Ortega assured President Chen after his
inauguration that Nicaragua's diplomatic relations with Taiwan
will remain unchanged.
