CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM NEEDED TO MAKE TAIWAN 'NORMAL COUNTRY':
CHEN
</HEADLINE>

Berlin,  April  26  (CNA) 04/26/07  13:59:28 (By Lin Yu-li and
Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Wednesday the country's need
to reform its constitution to make Taiwan a "normal country."
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a video conference with a group of German
politicians, academics and media representatives, Chen said that
many of the problems  that Taiwan faces today are related to its
constitutional system and that the country urgently needs a new
constitution that is viable and up to date.
</P>
<P>
First of all, Chen noted, Taiwan's current Constitution was
enacted in China 60 years ago without the consent of the people
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the constitutional system is confusing because it is
neither a parliamentary system nor a presidential system, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The president said various civil groups in the country have put
forth a total of 15 different versions of draft amendments to the
Constitution, including some that touch on sensitive issues such
as changing the country's official name to "Republic of Taiwan"
and forming a "second republic."
</P>
<P>
However, no matter which versions are adopted, they will have to
be approved by the Legislative Yuan first and passed in a public
referendum before they can be written into the Constitution, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan, like other emerging democracies, faces problems
such as vicious partisan  struggle,  transitional  justice and
constitutional reform, none of them are as serious as the
differences over national identity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed the rise of Taiwan consciousness in the country in
recent years proves that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
is on the right track and that more and more people believe the
party stands a good chance of winning the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's relations with China, Chen said unification between
the two sides is impossible at present because Beijing continues
to deny Taiwan's status as an independent sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the National Unification Council and the
National Unification Guidelines, which set unification with China
as the ultimate goal and which ceased to function and apply last
year, were adopted by the former Kuomintang government without
the people's consent.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the former government followed a "one China"
principle and used to compete with Beijing for the right to
represent "China, " but the present government recognizes that
"one China" refers to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that Taiwan is a separate country from China, Chen said
Taiwan now hopes to apply to join international organizations
such as the United States under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Chen pledged that he will continue to strengthen the Taiwanese
identity during the remaining year of his term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen expressed the hope that he will be able to visit
Germany as the president of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was meeting with the German friends via video
conference because no president of Taiwan has been able to obtain
a visa to visit Germany or any other European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Even though Taiwan has maintained diplomatic relations with the
Holy See for more than 60 years, no president of Taiwan had been
able to set foot on Vatican soil until 2005, when he was granted
permission to make a transit stop in Italy in order to be able to
attend the funeral of the late Pope John Paul II, he noted.
