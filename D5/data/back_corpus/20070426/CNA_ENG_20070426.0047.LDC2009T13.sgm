Beijing's proposed route for the 2008 Olympic torch relay is
unacceptable as it deliberately denigrates Taiwan's sovereign
status, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official who took part in the government's decision-making
process with regard to the Olympic torch relay made the remarks
after organizers for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games announced
what will be the longest torch relay in the games' history
earlier in the day. The route covers five continents and makes
politically sensitive stops in Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to China's plan, the Olympic torch would travel from
Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong
Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving in
the host city, Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The MAC official said Taiwan cannot accept the Beijing-proposed
torch relay route because it purposely includes Taipei as in its
"domestic leg" relay.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the government would have welcomed the
arrival of the Beijing Olympic torch should it come to Taipei via
a third country and travel next to a fourth country. He said
Beijing can consider having the torch come to Taipei from
Pyongyang, North Korea and then travel to Ho Chi Minh City. "The
ball is in Beijing's court," he added.

<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is more than willing to take part in all
sorts of International Olympic Committee-sponsored activities,
the official said Taiwan, however, cannot accept any arrangement
that denigrates its sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jong-her, Minister of the National Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports, and Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee Chairman
Thomas W. Tsai also said shortly after the Beijing's announcement
that the torch relay route was unacceptable on the grounds that
Taiwan's sovereign status would be compromised.
