The Humanistic Education Foundation (HEF) presented Thursday the
Chinese version of a guidance manual from the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on how
to discipline a child.
</P>
<P>
At the presentation ceremony held in Taipei, HEF founder and
Executive Chairman Shih Ying said the manual offers teachers and
parents positive ways to teach their children, instead of
traditional discipline practices such as corporal punishment.
</P>
<P>
In the manual, titled "Positive Discipline in the Inclusive,
Learning-Friendly Classroom, " the educational experts suggest
that teachers and parents respect the child's dignity; develop
pro-social behavior, self-discipline, and character; maximize the
child's active participation; respect the child's developmental
needs and quality of life; respect the child's motivational
characteristics and life views; assure fairness and
transformative justice; and promote solidarity among children.
</P>
<P>
The experts also suggest that teachers and parents reward and
recognize good behavior in four manners: describe the appropriate
behavior,  provide clear reasons,  request acknowledgement, and
reinforce correct behavior.
</P>
<P>
By giving eye-contact, a nod or a smile, an extra five minutes of
play time, extra credit points, or having good behavior praised
in front of a class or a school is the best way of rewarding a
good deed by children, which the experts say will have strong and
positive effects in disciplining children, the manual suggests.
