OFFICIALS, PRIVATE SECTOR NOT IN TUNE ON MINIMUM WAGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei, April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  21:11:45 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The country's trade and industrial sectors were out of tune with
the administration Thursday over the issue of a minimum wage
hike.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting called by Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L.
Chen on the minimum wage adjustment plan, representatives of the
Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) and
the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China (GCCROC)
did not agree with a 10-percent hike in the minimum wage proposed
by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).
</P>
<P>
The CLA recently suggested a 10-percent rise in the minimum wage
to make it more commensurate with Taiwan's general economic
situation and consumer price index. The wage has remained frozen
at the same level for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Ho Yu, a standing board member of the CNFI, said that if the
minimum wage is to be raised, it should be capped under five
percent, while GCCROC Secretary- General Chiu Chao-hsin said that
the GCCROC's bottom line is five percent and no higher.
</P>
<P>
Firmly opposing a 10-percent rise, Ho said the industrial sector
will have to pay an extra NT$3.6 billion (US$1.09 billion) to
workers if the minimum wage is hiked by one percent.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector will add an extra NT$14.5 billion to its
overhead costs if the minimum wage rises by five percent, and
NT$39.4 billion if the minimum wage is hiked 11 percent, Ho
continued.
</P>
<P>
Ho also quoted a recent poll conducted by the CNFI as indicating
that 56 percent of the federation's members are opposed to a
minimum wage hike,  while four percent  of the members agree with
a three-percent hike, 25 percent agree with a five-percent rise
and the remaining 15 percent favor a hike that exceeds five-
percent.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that it is untrue that the minimum wage has been frozen
for 10 years, arguing that over the past 10 years the average
work week has been shortened while employers have been made to
pay for overtime hours and various welfare measures.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiu, certain businesses, including traditional
manufacturing industries,  small-  and medium-size enterprises,
restaurants and other commercial services, will be among the
first sectors to bear the brunt of a minimum wage hike.
