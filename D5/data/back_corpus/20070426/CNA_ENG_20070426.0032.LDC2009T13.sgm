An opposition legislator sponsored a meeting in the eastern city
of Hualien Thursday, calling for Hualien residents to launch a
rally in Taipei May 3 in favor of the building of the
controversial  Suhua  freeway  connecting  Suao in the
northeastern county of Yilan with Hualien County.
</P>
<P>
It was resolved at the meeting that 10,000 Hualien residents, to
be led by three legislators from across the political spectrum
and four former Hualien magistrates, will proceed to Taipei May 3
and march to the Presidential  Office, the Executive  Yuan,  the
Environmental Protection Administration and the Landis Hotel
Taipei to rally support for the freeway and protest against those
who oppose the development plan, according to Fu Kun-chi, an
opposition People First Party legislator representing Hualien.
</P>
<P>
Fu called for Hualien residents to demonstrate esprit de corps,
saying that it is high time the Hualien people voice their cause
before the development plan is aborted under environmental
protection considerations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hualien County Council Speaker Yang Wen-chih, who co-
sponsored the meeting, claimed that the freeway is now a "common
wish of the Hualien residents, " although a related environmental
analysis  review that will decide the fate of the freeway's
development has become stuck due to intervention by the
environmental protection authorities and private environmental
groups.
</P>
<P>
Yang called for the Hualien residents to go for broke "to defend
their rights and interests."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Hualien tourism sector said they will
also stage a protest in front of Ritz Landis Hotel Taipei May 3
to vent their anger at Stanley Yen, chairman of the Landis hotel
group, who has voiced his opposition to the freeway development
plan recently, saying that the Suhua freeway development plan is
an ethical rather than a political issue.
