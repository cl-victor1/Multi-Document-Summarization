President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that he has asked the
Executive Yuan to study the issue of raising the monthly
allowance for elderly farmers by NT$1,000 (US$30) to NT$6,000 if
a proposed national pension program fails to clear the
legislature by July.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while inspecting a lychee farm in
Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan. Accompanying him were Cho
Jung-tai, deputy secretary- general of the Presidential Office,
and David Lee, director-general of the Presidential Office's
Department of Public Affairs.

<P>
Recent reports said that a draft bill on the national pension
program mapped out by the Ministry of the Interior will be sent
to the Executive Yuan for screening May 2. The Executive Yuan
hopes the draft bill can clear the Legislative Yuan by November
so that the program can be put into practice in January 2008, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill, the ensured persons will start to pay a
monthly premium of NT$618 at that age of 25 and will be entitled
to a monthly pension of NT$7,603 when they reach 65.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill calls for the integration of four current monthly
allowances -- the NT$3,000 monthly allowance for seniors, the
NT%5,999 for elderly farmers, the NT$3,000 for aboriginal
seniors, and the NT$6,000 for seniors in low-income households.
</P>
<P>
The allowances for the four groups of people will be scrapped in
due time so as to prevent political parties from proposing
increases in allowances ahead of every election to curry favor
with voters, thus exacerbating the government's already strained
financial situation, according to the draft bill.
