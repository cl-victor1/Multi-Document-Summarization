NO ALLOWANCE HIKE EVEN IF BILL FAILS TO CLEAR LEGISLATURE:
CABINET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April  26 (CNA) 04/26/07  20:44:22 (By Lilian Wu)

The Executive Yuan will not raise the monthly allowance for
elderly farmers even if a draft bill on a national pension
program fails to clear the Legislative Yuan by July, Cabinet
spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Executive Yuan will abide by a resolution passed by
a national economic development conference last year which stated
that no more increase on any stipends will be allowed before the
implementation of the national pension program.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mei-ling made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian
said earlier the same day during an inspection tour in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan, that he has asked the Executive Yuan to study
the issue of raising the monthly allowance for elderly farmers by
NT$1,000 to NT$6,000 if the proposed bill fails to pass the
legislature by July.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mei-ling stressed that the Cabinet is "not out of sync" with
the president on this point, saying that the president's main
intention is that "the Executive Yuan will do everything possible
to promote the draft bill so that it can clear the legislature
soon. "
</P>
<P>
She said that after sending the draft bill to the legislature
next week, the Cabinet will ask the Ministries of the Interior
and Economic Affairs to actively communicate and coordinate with
the Legislative Yuan on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the legislature, which will end its current session at
the end of May, will pass the bill in time, she only said that
the Cabinet will make every effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the legislature may convene an extraordinary session
whenever there are major bills pending, she added.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft bill, insured persons who start to pay a monthly
premium of NT$618 beginning at the age of 25 will be entitled to
a monthly pension of NT$7,603 when they reach 65. It is estimated
that 3.53 million persons will be included in the national
pension program.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill also calls for the integration of four current
monthly allowance programs -- the NT$3,000 monthly allowance for
seniors,  the NT$5,999 for elderly farmers,  the NT$3,000 for
aboriginal seniors and the NT$6,000 for seniors in low-income
households.
</P>
<P>
Once the national pension program is implemented, the allowances
targeting these four groups will be scrapped so as to prevent
political parties from proposing increases in allowances ahead of
every election to curry favor with voters, thus exacerbating the
government's already strained financial situation.
