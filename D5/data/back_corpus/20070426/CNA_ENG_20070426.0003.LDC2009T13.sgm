FORMER PREMIER PROMOTES FUND RAISING FOR KIDS' DRAMA IN TOWNSHIPS

Taipei,  April 25 (CNA) 04/26/07  11:11:31 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
Former Premier Frank C.T. Hsieh called on the public to
participate in a fund raising activity initiated by the
Paperwindmill Theater -- a kids' drama troupe -- to take their
performances for kids in townships around the island.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who is running for the Democratic Progressive Party's
nomination to run in the 2008 presidential election, made the
appeal together with the troupe's leader Jen Chien-cheng at a
news conference at Hsieh's campaign headquarter Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Hieh invited greater participation in the activity, called "Art
Project for Kids in 319 Townships -- First Mile Kid's Smile, "
which aims to solicit donations to enable the troupe to perform
for kids in each of Taiwan's 319 townships.
</P>
<P>
Participants may donate money to "adopt a performance" for
townships that they designated, and when designated funds for a
township reach NT$350,000 (US$10,545) ,  the troupe will make
arrangements to present a performance for the area's children.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he was touched by the headquarter's two volunteer
workers, who donated NT$60,000, and immediately followed suit,
donating funds to sponsor performances in Penghu County's Makung
City and Nantou County's Chushan Township.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his reasons for choosing the two places, Hsieh pointed
out that he changed his household registration to Penghu County
in the past in order to avoid being arrested by the Kuomintang,
and the Kaohsiung City government built more than 100
prefabricated temporary houses in Nantou for victims of 921
earthquake during his tenure as Kaohsiung City mayor.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the activity will allow children in remote places to
take in performance art that is not usually easy for them to
access as townships office cannot often afford the expense.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh hopes that more people will join in this activity, with
each individual donating NT$100 to help expand the horizons of
kids in far away townships.
