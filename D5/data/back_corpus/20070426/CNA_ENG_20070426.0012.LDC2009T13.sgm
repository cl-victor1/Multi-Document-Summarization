</HEADLINE>

Geneva, April 26 (CNA) 04/26/07  15:57:41 (By Sofia Wu)

Taiwan ranks 18th in the world in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions, with per capita emissions standing at 11.26 tons in
2004, a spokesman for the International Energy Agency (IEA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IEA spokesman was responding to an inquiry by CNA about the
exact figures of Taiwan's greenhouse gas emissions after a Taiwan
environmental researcher warned a day earlier that Taiwan ranked
first in the world in terms of per capita CO2 emissions growth
between 1990 and 2005.

<P>
Liu Shaw-chen, chief of the Academia Sinica's Research Center for
Environmental Change, also warned that Taiwan ranked fourth in
the world in terms of per capita greenhouse gas emissions, behind
only the United States, Australia and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The IEA spokesman, however, said that according to the IEA's 2006
study, Taiwan ranked 18th in per capita CO2 emissions, and not
fourth, in the world in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the IEA tallies showed that Taiwan outstripped
other East Asian countries in terms of per capita greenhouse gas
emissions in 2004, with South Korea ranking 25th in the world and
Japan ranking 26th.
</P>
<P>
According to the IEA data, Qatar ranked first in terms of per
capita greenhouse gas emissions at 49.64 tons, followed by
Kuwait, Luxembourg, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, the United
States, Australia and Canada, in that order.
