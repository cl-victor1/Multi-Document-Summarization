Taipei,  March  31 (CNA) 03/31/07  20:14:42 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Several chief prosecutors of high and district  prosecutor's
offices who are on a name list of a controversial personnel
reshuffle adopted by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) expressed
mixed opinions Saturday on the MOJ's latest decision to reopen a
meeting of the Prosecutors' Personnel Review Committee (PPRC) for
further talks on the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Ho Min-chen, chief prosecutor of the Yunlin District Prosecutors
Office, who turned down his new appointment as the chief
prosecutor in Pingtung, said he welcomes the decision and th at
he will reconsider whether or not to take the new post.
</P>
<P>
Chief Prosecutor  Ling Po-chih  of the Kaohsiung  District
Prosecutors Office, who refused to be assigned as MOJ chief
secretary, reiterated his decision not to assume office in the
new position, which described as being made out of personal
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the move to reopen the PPRC is meaningless and that he
only hopes for the reshuffle to be settled as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ announced the personnel adjustment Thursday, even though
more than half of the PPRC members refused to attend a committee
meeting held to ratify the reshuffle in protest against political
interference in the prosecution system by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Wen-ting, chief prosector of the Taiwan High Prosecutors
Office, who will be transferred to serve as prosecutor-general of
the Supreme Prosecutors Office, declined to comment on the MOJ
decision to reopen the PPRC.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether or not he is satisfied with his new post, Hsieh
said it was not his decision but that of the MOJ to make him
leave.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's transfer is widely considered the result of political
influence, as the chief prosecutor is in charge of a probe into
first lady Wu Shu-jen's alleged misuse of a special allowance set
aside for President Chen Shui-bian's discretionary use. Media
reports have said the Presidential Office applied pressure on the
prosecutor in an attempt to make him drop the case.
