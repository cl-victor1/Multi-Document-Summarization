DPP CHAIRMAN URGES HARSHER PUNISHMENT FOR TVBS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 31 (CNA) 03/31/07  17:16:55 (By Flor Wang)

Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
voiced Saturday his dissatisfaction with the light punishment
levied by the National Communications Commission (NCC) on the
TVBS network and urged the Executive Yuan to penalize the media
watchdog for failing to serve social justice.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks at a news conference after the NCC imposed a
fine of just NT$1 million each on the TVBS and TVBS-N channels a
day earlier for their recent broadcasting of staged footage
showing a hoodlum toying with handguns and threatening to seek
revenge on a rival thug. The NCC also demanded that TVBS remove
its general manager within seven days.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cable Radio and Television Law, the NCC is
entitled to have the license of TVBS revoked, as it seriously
violated the law by airing the gangster's film and damaged the
public interest, Yu said, arguing that the Executive Yuan should
"do something," such as freezing the NCC's budget, if it fails to
act.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the NCC is trying to cover up for TVBS, which
Yu said has acted with bias favoring the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" over the past more than one year.
</P>
<P>
NCC Chairman Su Yeong-chin and relevant NCC officials should be
held accountable for negligence, he said.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative caucus whip Wang To also criticized the NCC for
the light punishment it imposed on TVBS, saying that it would
only lead other media outlets to "follow suit."
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent that TVBS has its own political standing and it
is a reflection that the local media has embarked on the road to
degeneration, " Wang said, pointing out that a fine of just NT$1
million for TVBS is "a big joke" that will in turn invite other
TV stations to act rashly in the quest for higher audience
ratings.
</P>
<P>
"I support the idea of lawfully staging protests against the NCC
and TVBS," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the DPP accusations, Su said that the NCC meted
out the punishment for TVBS in accordance with the law and that
the DPP's demand that the TV network be shut down or its
operation licenses suspended goes beyond the range of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Su said that the NCC asked TVBS to dismiss its general manager in
compliance with Article 29 of the Satellite Broadcasting Law due
to its lax internal management after a thorough study and
consideration, not as a result of pressure from outside.
