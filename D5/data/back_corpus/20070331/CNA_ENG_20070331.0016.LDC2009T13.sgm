Taiwan's trade surplus this year will reach US$25.13 billion, an
increase of 18.09 percent year-on-year, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) forecast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA said that affected by the world economy, which will see
more modest growth this year, Taiwan's trade might not be as good
as last year but will still see steady growth, with export growth
at around 8.15 percent to reach US$242.25 billion and import
growth at 7.11 percent to reach US$217.12 billion.
</P>
<P>
The ministry commissioned the Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic
Research, a local think tank, to forecast the 2007 economy.
</P>
<P>
Chung-Hwa officials said that several factors that will be
favorable to Taiwan's trade include higher-than-predicted global
economic growth and dropping global oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Factors unfavorable to Taiwan's exports will include China's
macroeconomic policy to curb its overheated economy, as well as
the integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chung-Hwa officials said their forecast is based on the premises
of world and domestic economies growing at 3.3 percent and 4.3
percent, respectively and an exchange rate of 32.8 for the new
Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar.
