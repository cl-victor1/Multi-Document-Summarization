The number of children of China-based Taiwan businessmen being
schooled on the island of Kinmen has increased rapidly after a
series of incentives offered by the government, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's highest economic planning agency noted that a fund
to help development of the outlying island has provided NT$10
million (US$303,000) between 2003 and 2006 to encourage Taiwan
businessmen to send their children to school on Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
The incentives offered include free tuition and miscellaneous
fees, free lunches for elementary and junior high school
children, free transportation on the island and cheap
accommodation, as well as study assistance, CEPD officials said.
</P>
<P>
The policy has received a positive response from Taiwan
businessmen, and the number of their children studying on Kinmen
has risen to 102 in 2006 from 15 in 2002, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Taiwan businessmen used to leave their children
on Taiwan proper to attend school while they themselves shuttle
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. But with the rapid
economic development in China, the number of Taiwan businessmen
moving to China along with their families has gradually
increased.
</P>
<P>
CEPD officials noted that in Fujian Province's Fuzhou alone there
are around 20,000 Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
They noted that what bothers the Taiwan businessmen most is the
problem of education, especially as some businessmen have to
return to Taiwan after a stint of three or more years and want
their children to integrate into Taiwan's educational system
after their return, making Kinmen an attractive prospect for
their education while the family is living in China.
