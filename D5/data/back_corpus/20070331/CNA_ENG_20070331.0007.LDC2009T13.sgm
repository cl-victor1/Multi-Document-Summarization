GOVERNMENT TAKES OVER ANOTHER TROUBLED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 30 (CNA) 03/31/07  12:58:14 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The nation's top financial regulator said Friday that he had
assigned the Central Depository Insurance Corp. (CDIC) to take
over the financially troubled China United Trust &amp; Investment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) , noted that the bank has become the fourth bank to be
taken over by the government since the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that both the finance and business operations of the
trust company have been dismal, with its net worth registering
minus NT$319 million (US$9.66 million) as of the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax surplus was minus NT$246 million and if bad debts were
included, the losses would amount to minus NT$2.98 billion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that the company has been unable to stay afloat through
capital augmentation and that it is continuing to lose money,
with the amount of liquid capital amounting to only NT$350
million, which he said can hardly even cope with money
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
During the takeover, the duties of the directors and supervisors
will be suspended and related duties will be exercised by
government representatives.
</P>
<P>
The FSC said that in line with the financial restructuring
mechanism, all capital put into the trust of the company will be
fully guaranteed and all services will be taken over by the Bank
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A panic run is "absolutely unnecessary," the FSC added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FSC Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang said that three other
banks taken over by the CDIC previously will be sold to the
highest bidders between June and August at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Chang was referring to the Taitung Business Bank, the Enterprise
Bank of Hualien and The Chinese Bank, which were taken over in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the first one will probably announce an invitation
for open bidding in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
She said the FSC exchanged views with financial groups on how to
arrange for bidding Friday but has yet to come to a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
The FSC is not ruling out the possibility of international groups
taking part in the bidding, she added.
