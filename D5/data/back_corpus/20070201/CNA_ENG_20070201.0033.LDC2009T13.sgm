CHINA MAY DESTROY WORLD'S CHIP SUPPLY CHAIN IF IT ATTACKS TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb.  1 (CNA) 02/01/07  19:49:12 (By Jorge Liu and

Chinese provocations against Taiwan could result in an extended
disruption to the world's chip supply chain, particularly as
Taiwan is set to become the world's leading manufacturer of DRAM
chips in 2007, U.S.-Taiwan Business Council President Rupert
Hammond-Chambers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers said the recent destruction of a satellite by a
Chinese ICBM renewed concerns over China's military intentions
and its "peaceful" rise in Asia. "It also drew the world's
attention to potential flash points, including Taiwan and the
possibility that China would resort to using force to reunify
with the island, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The missile test took place just prior to the release of the
council's "Semiconductor Report - Annual Review 2006, " which
anticipates that Taiwan will become the world's leading
manufacturer of DRAM chips in 2007, Hammond-Chambers noted.
</P>
<P>
He quoted  the report in highlighting  Taiwan's  strategic
importance in the chip industry. Taiwan is home to the world's
highest concentration of advanced 12-inch semiconductor
fabrication plants.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted data from Taiwan's Institute for Information
Industry that indicates that Taiwan is not only the leading
producer of important semiconductor technologies like DRAM,  but
Taiwan companies are also responsible for a significant share of
global technology production, including approximately 82 percent
of notebook computers, 98 percent of motherboards, and 72 percent
of LCD monitors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies sourced an estimated US$73.3 billion of technology
products from Taiwan in 2006 alone, an 11 percent increase over
2005, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers said the global economy is increasingly reliant
on the supply chain synergies that run through Taiwan and its
regional  partners.  "These partnerships  produce  many of the
technological products on which we have become reliant, and which
improve business productivity and empower consumers. Present
trends point towards Taiwan strengthening its position in certain
key sectors, particularly in semiconductors," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hammond-Chambers  said the council is concerned  about the
potential costs to the United States if that critical supply
chain is severed by "acts of god" such as an earthquake like that
which struck in 1999, or if provocative actions undertaken by
Beijing resulted in an extended supply chain disruption.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductors are critical not only to commercial businesses,
but also to modern warfare, he said, adding that a reliable and
robust supply base is a crucial component of any country's modern
military. This is true in particular for the United States, as it
relies on a single semiconductor manufacturer to provide it with
all of the chips it requires for national security, and where
additional supplies of chips must come from commercial sources,
he said.
