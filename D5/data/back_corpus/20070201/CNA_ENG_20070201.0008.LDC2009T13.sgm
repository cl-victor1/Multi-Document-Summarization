The U.S. State Department reiterated Wednesday that the Taiwan
Relations Act remains one of the basic guidelines for U.S. policy
on cross-Taiwan Strait ties and that the United States will
fulfill its obligations towards Taiwan as defined in the law.
</P>
<P>
"It (the Taiwan Relations Act) still applies, and we still intend
to live up to our obligations, " State Department spokesman Sean
McCormack said during a daily press briefing, in response to a
question on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the U.S. policy on cross-strait relations during a
Senate hearing Tuesday, John Negroponte, nominee for deputy
secretary of state, said the United States supports a "one-China"
policy and sticks to the three communiques with China but stopped
short of mentioning the Taiwan Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
According  to Negroponte,  Taiwan's  plan to enact  a new
constitution might conflict with the U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the State Department has tried to privately advise
Taiwan to drop the plan, McCormack said: "We have made very clear
what our policy is, and it's no different than what you have
heard in public."
