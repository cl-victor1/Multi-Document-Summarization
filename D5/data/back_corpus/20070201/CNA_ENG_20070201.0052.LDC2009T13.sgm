MOEA TO REVIEW CARLYLE GROUP'S ASE BUYOUT BID

Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/01/07  23:23:12 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will start to review a
Carlyle Group's proposed buyout of Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering, Inc. (ASE) after completing consultations with
relevant government agenices, an official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remarks after the U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council called for the Taiwan government a day earlier to swiftly
complete the application process for Carlyle Group's ASE
acquisition bid.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, a non-profit association that
groups companies involved in business between Taiwan and the
United States, said in a news release that the potential deal
highlights the ability  of Taiwan companies  to attract
substantial  foreign investments, greatly benefiting Taiwan's
economy.
</P>
<P>
It also underscores the attractiveness of Taiwan's semiconductor
market, which the council has predicted will become the world's
largest market for chip equipment spending and for DRAM
production in 2007,  due largely to new partnerships  and a
number of new investments, the press statement said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the U.S. council's comments, the MOEA official in
charge of investment affairs said the buyout application is still
in the opinion- soliciting stage.
</P>
<P>
Once the opinion-soliciting process is finalized, the official
said the MOEA's Investment Commission will start to review the
case and make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
The Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity
firms, offered in early January to purchase ASE, the world's
largest chip packaging and testing company, for approximately
US%5.5 billion and take it private.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, the Carlyle
Group's intention to enter Taiwan's semiconductor market reflects
the high caliber of Taiwan businesses and a desire to link the
U.S. and Taiwan -- arguably the two most important semiconductor
markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to move away from the notion that only
semiconductor companies can realize synergies through mergers and
acquisitions in the semiconductor sector. Private equity firms
are also well positioned to add value for shareholders, market
sectors, and economies," the council said in its press statement.
