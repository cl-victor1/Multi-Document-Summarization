TOO EARLY TO SAY WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM REDISTRICTING SCHEME:
PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/01/07  21:18:54 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Thursday that it is too early to say
who will benefit most from the redistricting scheme for the year-
end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks after media reports speculated that the
redrawing of the 73 constituencies of the nation's 25 cities and
countries  could mean more polarization  of Taiwan's political
landscape, with southern Taiwan, which is a stronghold of the
"pan-green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), turning greener and northern Taiwan, which usually tilts
toward the "pan-blue alliance" led by the Kuomintang (KMT),
becoming more blue.
</P>
<P>
The premier said it is impossible to tell which camp will gain
more from the new scheme, saying that it will rely on the
strength and efforts of the various parties and candidates.
</P>
<P>
The redistricting  was made necessary  because  of a 2005
constitutional amendment that changed the electoral system for
the seventh legislature to a "single-seat constituency, two
votes" from the present "multiple-seat constituency" and that
will see the legislature cut by half to 113 members, including 73
regional seats from each constituency,  six seats for aborigines
and 34 for legislators-at-large.
</P>
<P>
"The redrawing of the constituencies is crucial to each party and
candidate, " Su said, adding that this is why the redistricting
work is so grueling and why eight contentious cities and counties
had to resort to a last-minute drawing of lots.
</P>
<P>
Su said that since Jan. 24 he had met with Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin- pyng five times for negotiations to try to
thrash out the differences over the eight cities and counties,
without success.
</P>
<P>
The matter finally had to rely on the drawing of lots to choose
from resolutions floated by the Central Election Commission (CEC)
, the Legislative Yuan and various parties.
</P>
<P>
Su expressed hope that all parties "if not satisfied with the
result, can at least accept it and then make the best efforts for
the year-end elections."
</P>
<P>
The redistricting scheme shows that 21 cities and counties,
including  Taipei and Taichung cities and Miaoli and Changhua
counties, which were decided by lot drawing, have followed the
redrawing scheme worked out by the CEC.
</P>
<P>
While Taipei County, which has the largest number of 12 seats due
to its large population, follows a proposal by the opposition
Taiwan Solidarity Union, Taoyuan County adopts a version from the
DPP and Kaohsiung City uses a version agreed upon by the
Legislative Yuan. Pingtung County adopts a version proposed by
the KMT, the People First Party, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and
the Non- partisan Solidarity Union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, faced with more competitive elections with greatly
reduced seats, DPP Legislator Chen Chin-jun said the DPP has to
work with the TSU, saying that if the TSU fields its own
candidate in each constituency, it will impact the "pan- green
camp."
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator John Chiang estimated that the new scheme will be
favorable to the major parties and that the KMT, which currently
controls 90 seats in the 219-seat legislature, will garner two-
thirds of the seats.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Cheng Chin-ling said her party and the KMT will
have to meet next week at the latest to talk about fielding
candidates, as the two parties will be soliciting support from
the same voters.
</P>
<P>
In related development, Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun said
he regretted the result of the draw.
</P>
<P>
Chu said the initial redistricting scheme sent by the county to
the CEC was based on Chungli and Taoyuan cities having the
largest township-level cities in one constituency each, while the
final version has cut more than 10 boroughs each from the two
cities and has given them to other constituencies.
</P>
<P>
But Hsu Chung-wen, director of the DPP's Taoyuan branch, was
elated, saying that the new scheme will finally break the KMT's
traditional hold on the two cities and that the DPP will be able
to win half of the six seats in Taoyuan County.
