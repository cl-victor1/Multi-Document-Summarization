EX-PRESIDENT LEE NOT DROPPING TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE: TSU LAWMAKERS

Former President Lee Teng-hui's recent remarks about his hope to
visit China and his denouncement of Taiwan independence were only
a joke because Lee has never abandoned his desire to make Taiwan
a normal country, members of the legislative caucus of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The clarification of Lee's stance regarding Taiwan's future by
TSU lawmakers at a news conference came one day after Next
Magazine reported in its latest edition that Lee hopes to visit
China, forswears Taiwan independence and calls for the government
to open up to Chinese capital and tourists.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside rampant speculation that Lee has again changed his
attitude regarding Taiwan's future, TSU legislative caucus whip
Tseng Tsahn-deng said that Lee was only stressing that there is
no need to fuel Taiwan independence debate at the present stage
because Taiwan is already an independent sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
According to Tseng, Lee still harbors the dream of turning Taiwan
into a normal country through writing a new constitution for the
country and changing its official designation, and calls for
joint efforts from all pro-independence activists.
</P>
<P>
The former president was only kidding when saying that he hopes
to visit China, and his call for an opening to Chinese capital
was only part of his efforts to reverse trends that have resulted
in a steady capital flow to China, Tseng explained, adding that
Lee is deeply worried that continuous investment in China will
eventually hurt this country.
