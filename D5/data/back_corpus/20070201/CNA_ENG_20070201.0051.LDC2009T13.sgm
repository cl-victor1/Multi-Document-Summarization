Two state-run enterprises -- Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp.
(TTL) and Taiyen Biotech Co. -- have announced their intention to
explore overseas markets with China topping their list of desired
locations, company spokesmen said Thursday.

TTL Chairman Martin Tsai said that the company's cigarettes are
selling very well at five duty-free shops in China. He added that
the company aims to further expand its business this year as it
has won approval from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to set
up offices in Beijing and Shanghai.

In addition, Tsai said that TTL has completed the first selection
of agents for its Chinese operations and TTL will place its
cigarette products for sale at an additional 152 duty-free shops
at airports, harbors, and customs in China, he noted.

Meanwhile, TTL plans to begin selling its products through taxed
sales channels in China, the chairman said.

Noting that the Chinese government has capped the total volume of
tobacco and liquor imports, he estimated that TTL will have a
quota of around 20,000 units that it may sell each year in
Chinese shops.

Taiyen Chairman Lin Ching, for his part, announced that the salt
firm has registered its cosmetics products in China, and that
these are expected to go on sale soon.
