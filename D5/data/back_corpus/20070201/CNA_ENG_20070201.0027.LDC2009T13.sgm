<P>
There is ample room for Taiwan to promote its bananas in Japan,
an official of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA Deputy Secretary General Yeh Ming-shui made the remarks as
he presided over a meeting in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, at
which representatives from Taiwan and Japan took part. Japanese
representatives had visited banana growing farms at Chishan and
Meinung, Kaohsiung a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Yeh noted that Taiwan exported US$3.29 billion worth of
agriculture products in 2006, and Japan was one of its most
important export markets, especially regarding fresh fruits.
Bananas have been a mainstay of Taiwan's exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
But Yeh noted that Philippine bananas have a market share of
around 88.5 percent in Japan, which consumes around one million
tons of bananas every year. The Philippines' market share is
followed by that of Ecuator, Mexico and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Bananas from Taiwan enjoy a market share of only 1.4 percent in
Japan, Yeh said, showing that there is room for further growth.
</P>
<P>
TAITRA has touted the unique flavor of locally produced bananas
to the Japanese, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
The council also hopes that local banana growers will pay
attention to quality control to reassure Japanese buyers and
encourage them to increase their purchases, he added.
