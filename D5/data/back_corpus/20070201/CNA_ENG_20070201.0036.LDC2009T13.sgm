The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is to establish a new
facility in the eastern county of Taitung, utilizing deep ocean
water to cultivate high-altitude vegetables, mushrooms and
flower, MOEA officials said Thursday.

The project comes after the successful application of deep ocean
water to bottled drinking water, cosmetics and aquaculture to
further exploit the business opportunity of "blue gold" -- a
nickname for deep ocean water, they said.

According to MOEA tallies, five local companies invested NT$3
billion (US$91 million) in research and manufacturing facilities
along the eastern coast between 2004 and 2005, while three of
them plan to put in an additional NT$11.2 billion in the coming
two years.

The officials said the estimated production value of deep ocean
water-related business will reach NT$1 billion in three years,
while after six years, the total output value would top NT$18
billion.

The budget of the new facility for high-altitude produce is about
NT$384 million and an MOEA review committee is working on a
shortlist of site choices, with a final decision to be announced
in one week.
