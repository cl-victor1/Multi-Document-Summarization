TAIWAN-DEVELOPED PIGS OFFER PROSPECT FOR XENOTRANSPLANTATION

Pigs with genes resistant to rejection have been produced in
Taiwan and offer the prospect of supplying organs for transplant
into human bodies, a local researcher said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tu chin-fu, chief of the Division of Biotechnology at the Animal
Technology Institute Taiwan, said his research team has developed
pigs which carry transplanted genes resistant to acute and severe
acute rejection which are common in organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
Noting that thousands of people around the world who need organ
transplants die before suitable donors can be found every year,
Tu said xenotransplantation may offer an option to solve the
shortage of donated human organs.
</P>
<P>
Pigs, like baboon and chimpanzees, are close to human beings in
physical construction, but unlike the baboon and chimpanzees,
they are not protected animals, and therefore are promising
suppliers of organs for human beings, Tu went on.
</P>
<P>
One of the major obstacles in transplanting organs between
different species is rejection, which leads to the failure of the
alien organs in the new host body.
</P>
<P>
However, Tu said, his team has succeeded in transplanting six
genes which resist rejection into the genome of the pigs.
</P>
<P>
During a test designed to examine these genes' effective in human
bodies, Tu said his team circulated human blood into kidneys and
lungs removed from such pigs and found that the removed organs
work quiet well.
</P>
<P>
The success of the experiment has placed his team at the
forefront of this field in the world, Tu said. The next step for
his team, Tu said, will be to develop pigs which carry all of the
six rejection-resistant genes and produce them in en mass for
widespread use.
