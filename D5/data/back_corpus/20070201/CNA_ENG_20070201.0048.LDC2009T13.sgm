Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA) 02/01/07  22:25:51 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
A batch of 120,000 sets of "Year of the Pig" commemorative coins
issued by the Taipei-based Central Bank of China sold out in less
than a day Thursday, the first day they were put on the market.
</P>
<P>
Each coin set, priced at NT$1,350, consists of three coins -- a
one-ounce silver coin with a face value of NT$100 and two coins
with face values of NT$50 and NT$20, respectively. They all
feature the pig as their motif in celebration of the Feb. 18
arrival of the lunar calendar's Year of the Pig.
</P>
<P>
Most of the coin sets were sold at the Bank of Taiwan's 147
branches throughout Taiwan. A small number -- about 6,000 sets --
were sold at the 21 branches of the Central Trust of China.
</P>
<P>
Buyers formed long queues at the outlets, and by 3 p.m. Thursday,
all 120,000 sets had been sold.
</P>
<P>
Although each person was allowed to buy only one set, some
collectors who arrived early and bought a first set were seen
sneaking back to the end of the queue and managing to get an
extra set.
