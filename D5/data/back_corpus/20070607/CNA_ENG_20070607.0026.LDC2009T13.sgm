Japan's Interchange Association (IA) Kaohsiung Office Director
Hiromichi Kambe wound up a two-day visit to Penghu County
Thursday that he made to gain a better understanding of the
offshore county's tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Kambe visited Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa the previous
day and exchanged views with him on the county's tourism
development and its "mini three links," which allow Penghu
residents to travel to China's Fujian Province via direct ferry
routes through Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Wang told Kambe that environmental protection and marine resource
preservation have been taken by the county government and local
residents as important directions for the development of tourism.
The protection of natural beauty should attract more tourists to
visit the county's world-class attractions such as its basalt
columns, Wang added.

<P>
He noted that a delegation of the county's cross-Taiwan Strait
exchange association visited Fujian in April via the "mini three
links" to promote Penghu tourism, and added that a group of about
119 members to be led by Fujian officials will visit Penghu
County June 11.
</P>
<P>
He also said construction of many five-star hotels will be
completed within two years.
</P>
<P>
Kambe suggested that in addition to five-star hotels, the county
government could consider building clubs to provide comfortable
long-stays with lower prices to backpackers. He also promised to
help promote Penghu tourism.
