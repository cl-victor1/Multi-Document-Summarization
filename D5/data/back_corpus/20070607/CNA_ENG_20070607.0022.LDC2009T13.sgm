CHINA WILL NOT RELAX SUPPRESSION FOR NEW TAIWAN LEADER: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  18:43:28 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that China will not relax
its suppression of Taiwan when the country's new president is
elected next year.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China's diplomatic suppression of Taiwan has been
consistent irrespective of which political party is in power and
it is unlikely to change with a new president.
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks came in a news release as Foreign Affairs
Minister James Huang announced earlier that day the decision to
sever diplomatic relations with Costa Rica after the Central
American country switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing, ending a 63-year diplomatic relationship.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the changes in diplomatic ties with Costa Rica did not
come as a surprise, noting that there were warning signs in that
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias met with then-Chinese Foreign
Minister Li Zhaoxing during last year's United Nations meeting in
September, while Costa Rica opposed Taiwan's bid to gain
membership in the World Health Organization (WHO) during this
year's World Health Assembly conference last month.
</P>
<P>
The president said that in addition to stepping up its military
threat against Taiwan, China has also used every means to block
and contain the country diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
"China is attempting to blot Taiwan out of the international
community completely by luring away all its diplomatic allies,
containing any maneuvering space of Taiwan and squeezing all its
bargaining chips in negotiations," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that faced with the suppression, isolation and
downgrading attempts by China, he has "engaged in diplomatic
battles with China daily" since first assuming the presidency in
2000.
