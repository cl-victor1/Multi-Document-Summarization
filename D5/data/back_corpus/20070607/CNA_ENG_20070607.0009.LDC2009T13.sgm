ROC SEVERS DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH COSTA RICA (UPDATE-1)
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  11:43:15 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang announced Thursday the
government's decision to sever diplomatic relations  with Costa
Rica after the Central American  nation proclaimed the
establishment of diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Huang expressed regret at Costa Rica's decision, which he called
the result of "threat and financial temptation" by China.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of upholding national interests and dignity, the
government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) has decided to
terminate formal relations with the Republic of Costa Rica and
cease all cooperation projects between the two countries, " Huang
said, reading from a prepared statement during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Since forging diplomatic relations with Costa Rica in 1944,
Taiwan  had actively assisted  Costa  Rica in improving  its
infrastructure and promoting national development, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
However, with disregard for the longstanding friendship with
Taiwan, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has held several secret
talks with China on the establishment of diplomatic ties since
his inauguration in May 2006, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
Huang said despite Taiwan's efforts to communicate with the
government of Costa Rica with utmost sincerity, Costa Rica still
decided to cling to its own way and chose to "discard the
universal values of peace, freedom and human rights commonly
treasured by Taiwan and Costa Rica, and to turn to ally with the
totalitarian communist China."
</P>
<P>
Huang claimed that Arias's move goes against the founding spirit
of Costa Rica and the ideals of the Nobel Peace Prize, which
Arias won in 1987 for his efforts to end civil wars then raging
in several Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
Huang further condemned  China for resorting  to checkbook
diplomacy to suppress Taiwan's participation in the international
community, a practice which he said "seriously hurts the feelings
of the Taiwanese people."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Taiwan will continue to promote pragmatic
diplomacy to enhance the country's international profile and to
safeguard the country's interests and its people's well-being.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica signed a joint communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations with China June 1 but did not publicize the
news until June 6.
</P>
<P>
After severing formal diplomatic ties with Costa Rica, Taiwan now
has a total of 24 diplomatic allies around the world.
