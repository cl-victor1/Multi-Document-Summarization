COSTA RICA ACCUSED OF 'CHEATING' TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  14:08:08 (By Y.F. Low and Ramon
Huang)
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang accused Costa Rica
Thursday of repeatedly "cheating" Taiwan in the process of its
forging diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Huang described the manner in which Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias handled the matter as an irony, considering the fact that
Arias is a Nobel Peace Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that even before his inauguration in May 2006,
Arias had harbored the idea of establishing diplomatic ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
In what were considered alarm signals of possible change in
Taiwan-Costa Rica relations, Arias met with Chinese Foreign
Minister Li Zhaoxing during last year's United Nations meeting
held in September, and Costa Rica opposed Taiwan's bid to gain
membership in the World Health Organization during this year's
World Health Assembly held in May, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Even before flying secretly to Beijing in late May, Costa Rican
Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno lied to the media that his
country's relations with Taiwan remained unchanged, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
Stagno signed a joint communique on the establishment  of
diplomatic relations between Costa Rica and China with his
Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in Beijing June 1. But Costa
Rica did not publicize the news until June 6.
</P>
<P>
In response to the development, Huang on Thursday announced
Taiwan's decision to sever diplomatic ties with Costa Rica and
cease all cooperation projects between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In Costa Rica Wednesday, Taiwan's embassy in the Central American
nation lodged a strong protest over the Costa Rican government's
"extremely unfriendly" move of switching recognition to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The Costa Rican government should bear the responsibility and
all consequences for betraying the 63-year-long friendship with
Taiwan," the embassy said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan will close down its embassy in Costa Rica, terminate all
aid projects for the Central American nation and recall its
technical corps there, according to the statement.
