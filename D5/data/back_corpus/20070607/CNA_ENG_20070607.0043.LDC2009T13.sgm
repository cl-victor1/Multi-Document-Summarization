A Taiwanese entrepreneur has donated NT$30 million (US$905,470)
in scholarships to help 300 less-privileged students in various
stages of schooling, Vice President Annette Lu disclosed
Thursday.

Lu said the anonymous donor is a young industrialist who started
his enterprise from scratch and wishes to use his money to help
100 junior middle school students, 100 high school students and
100 university students.
</P>
<P>
She added that a committee in charge of the "Little Scholars
After-School Study Program, " which she and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng launched in January to help pupils from
low-income and less-privileged families, will begin to accept
applications for the scholarships in September.
</P>
<P>
She also said the legislative speaker had mustered NT$9 million
to help the after-school study program's 128 classes throughout
Taiwan to continue operating.
</P>
<P>
Lu pointed out that the program, entirely supported by private
donors, has attracted some 2,500 less-privileged students who
meet three or four times each week at selected locations in their
communities to receive help from teachers of different courses.

<P>
The vice president pledged that she will continue to look for
philanthropists among Taiwan's successful entrepreneurs to
support the program.
