MINISTER TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE AT 9 A.M. ON COSTA RICA TIES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  08:40:19 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will hold a news
conference at 9 a.m. Thursday to brief the press on the
government's response to Costa Rica's decision to switch
diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNA report from Panama City, Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias announced his administration's decision to establish
diplomatic relations with China shortly after urgently summoning
Republic of China Ambassador Wu Tzu-dan to inform him of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
While announcing his government's decision to forge ties with
China, the CNA report said, Arias said that his government will
maintain unofficial ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign wire service reports, Arias announced at 5:
15 p.m. Wednesday (local time) that Costa Rica has broken
diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Arias' announcement came a day after Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Bruno Stagno was quoted by a Spanish-language wire service report
as having denied that his country's relations with Taiwan would
have a "major twist" soon.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China has relentlessly strive to use its economic clout
to lure away Taiwan's diplomatic allies, including Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
Since he assumed the ambassadorial post, Wu said pro-China Costa
Rican politicians and celebrities have shuttled between San Jose
and Beijing to boost bilateral engagements. Over the past year,
Wu said, Costa Rican and Chinese diplomats have held many rounds
of meetings in private.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the World Health Organization's (WHO)
annual assembly in Geneva May 14, Wu recalled that he had held
three rounds of meeting with Stagno and two rounds of talks with
the Costa Rican health minister on Taiwan's decision to apply for
WHO membership. Both of them promised to support Taiwan's bid,
but they backed off the promise. The Costa Rican ambassador to
the WHO gave an unexpected "no" vote at the WHO assembly on a
proposal to include Taiwan's membership bid into its discussion
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica established diplomatic ties with the ROC in 1944. A
Taiwanese diplomat stationed in Central America said he is
worried that Costa Rica's switching of diplomatic recognition
could trigger a "domino effect" and affect Taiwan's ties with its
other Central American allies.
