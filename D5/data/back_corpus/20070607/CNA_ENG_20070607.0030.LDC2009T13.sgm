MAC BLASTS BEIJING'S SUPPRESSION OF TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  20:06:44 (By Flor Wang)

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued a statement Thursday
condemning Beijing's constant suppression of Taiwan, saying that
China's bullying of Taiwan will only drive the two countries
further apart.
</P>
<P>
The MAC statement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
announced earlier in the day the termination of Taiwan-Costa Rica
diplomatic ties after the Central American nation proclaimed its
establishment of diplomatic links with Beijing hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the severance of Taiwan-Costa Rica diplomatic ties
-- Taiwan's latest setback in its diplomatic war against China --
the MAC called on the public not to harbor any illusions about
China, given Beijing's apparent ambition to swallow up the
country.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's objectives of making Taiwan a province of China and
excluding Taiwan from the international arena is obvious, it
said, pointing out that Beijing's growing military buildup aimed
at Taiwan and its increasing squeeze of Taiwan internationally
are the prime barriers to any improvement in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's two-pronged approach -- paying lip service to two-way
exchanges to court the Taiwan people while seeking to impose a
full blockade of Taiwan on the world stage -- is ubiquitous, the
MAC said, adding that "some people's wishful thinking" of holding
negotiations with China will only provide Beijing with a pretext
to further suppress Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's series of "uncouth and barbarian" reactions against
Taiwan are doomed to fuel resentment among Taiwan's people and
the communist Chinese regime must be held responsible for the
growing alienation between the two sides, according to the MAC.
