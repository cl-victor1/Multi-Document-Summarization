Taipei,  June 7 (CNA) 06/07/07  20:05:09 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Outgoing Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Chang Cheng-
hsiung denied Thursday that a "conspiracy" was behind the CEC's
decision to hold the next legislative election Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
Chang brushed off the allegation while answering questions from
lawmakers after having reported on the CEC's programming of the
next legislative and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In response to main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers'
suspicion that the date for the seventh Legislative Yuan has been
put off to Jan. 12, 2008 from the originally projected December
this year to hobble KMT supporter turnout, Chang replied that the
date was set based on a majority agreement after thorough study
and discussion by CEC members.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely not any conspiracy behind the decision and
it is the best date among all those that have been assessed, "
Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the possibility that the date for the legislative
election could be overturned by the next CEC as the current CEC
members are set to step down from their posts June 16, Chang said
that the new CEC is entitled to make changes in this regard.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of whether the legislative and presidential
elections should be held at the same time, Chang said that is an
issue for the new CEC to decide, but that such a development is
feasible.
</P>
<P>
The next presidential election is tentatively scheduled for early
2008.
