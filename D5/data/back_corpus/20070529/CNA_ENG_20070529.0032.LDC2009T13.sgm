Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin launched an energy-saving campaign
Tuesday, urging the city's 415 municipal schools and
organizations to reduce their electricity consumption by at least
1 percent each year in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Hau told a city government meeting that city government agencies
achieved the goal of cutting electricity consumption by 2 percent
last year and saved NT$1.01 million, and that there is still room
for further improvement by asking other municipal organizations
and schools to join in the efforts.
</P>
<P>
At present,  the 415 Taipei  City-affiliated  schools  and
organizations consume  about  1.2  billion  kilowatt-hours  of
electricity. If they can reduce consumption by 1 percent, it
would cut NT$25 million from the city's electricity bills, Hau
said.
</P>
<P>
Hau also said that in observance of the energy-saving plan, the
city government will require that temperatures for air-
conditioning in office buildings during the summer be set between
26 and 28 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that employees be encouraged to dress casually
in the hot season, instead of wearing suits and ties.
</P>
<P>
Other energy-saving measures include replacing energy-wasting
incandescent light bulbs with energy-efficient bulbs and
encouraging people not to use the elevator when they are only
going to the second or third floor, according to the mayor.
