TAIWAN RECORDS YEAR'S FIRST INDIGENOUS MUMPS CASE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  29 (CNA) 05/29/07  15:24:15 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Tuesday the
country's first indigenous mumps case for this year.
</P>
<P>
The case involves a 11-year-old boy in central Yunlin County, who
displayed symptoms of high fever, loss of appetite, headache, and
swelling and pain in the parotid glands May 4, said CDC Deputy
Director-General Lin Ting.
</P>
<P>
Doctors diagnosed the boy as being infected with mumps May 5,
with test results confirming the diagnosis May 21, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The boy was infected despite having previously received two doses
of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, Lin said, adding that
no abnormalities have been detected in his immune system.
</P>
<P>
None of his family members or classmates have displayed symptoms
of infection, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the MMR vaccination does not provide 100 percent
protection against mumps infection, with protection reaching 80
percent after the first dose and rising to 90 percent after the
second dose.
</P>
<P>
Despite this deficiency, Lin urged parents to make sure their
children receive the first dose of MMR vaccine when they are
between 12-15 months old and the second dose during their first
year of elementary school.
</P>
<P>
The MMR immunization is important to prevent an epidemic similar
to the most recent measles outbreak in Japan's Kanto region, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDC,  mumps is an acute viral infection
transmissible through saliva and is prevalent during winter and
spring.
</P>
<P>
The incubation period of the disease ranges between 12-25 days,
and a single natural infection usually gives life-long protection
against a repeat infection.
</P>
<P>
While 20 percent to 30 percent of mumps-infected men develop
inflammation of the testicles, 5 percent of mumps-infected women
develop inflammation of the ovaries, and infection during the
first three months of pregnancy increases the risk of
miscarriage.
