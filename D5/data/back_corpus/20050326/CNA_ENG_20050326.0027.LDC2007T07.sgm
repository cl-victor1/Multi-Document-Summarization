PROTEST UNLIKELY TO HALT ANTI-SECESSION LEGISLATION: OBSERVERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  March 26 (CNA) (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
Despite a large protest in Taipei against China's Anti-Secession Law,
Beijing is unlikely to halt its legislation process to iron out more
by-laws to step up its threats against Taiwan, political observers
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Byron S. J. Weng, a national policy advisor to President Chen Shui-
bian and professor at National Chi Nan University, opined, however,
that Beijing should be more concerned about follow-up reactions from
the United States and European countries in the wake of the March 26
protest in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Weng told CNA that it is still too early to talk about possible
effects of the march for Beijing, and he contented that it is unlikely
that Beijing will stop its legislation moves to further oppress
Taiwan. But he said that support from the U. S. and the European Union
(E. U.) should push Beijing to review its hegemonic attitude toward
Taiwan.

Lin Chong-pin, a former vice minister of national defense and a vice
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, echoed Weng by saying that
it is hard to judge whether the protest march would exact a price in
bilateral ties and claimed that Beijing would care more about ensuing
responses from the U. S. and the E. U. because Beijing is dealing with
the Taiwan issue through a global strategic viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that he does not think that Beijing would overreact to the
protest march in the near term, as protesters showed restraint.
