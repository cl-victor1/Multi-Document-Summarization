The Taiwan International Health Action (TaiwanIHA), a government-
funded organization to offer international medical aid, published
Thursday a photo album recording Taiwan's medical humanitarian
aid to foreign countries from 2000 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mao, Minister of Foreign Affairs
James Huang, Executive Director of the International Center for
Migration and Health (ICMH) Manuel Carballo, and several foreign
envoys stationed in Taiwan attended the launch of the album,
titled "Passion and Care," at MOFA's personnel training center in
Taipei.

<P>
Hou said the establishment of the TaiwanIHA was a concrete
reflection of Taiwan's contribution to the world community, which
he said has significantly strengthened Taiwan's relations with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Taiwan  is striving  to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) as a full member, and expressed the hope that
the world community will extend its support to Taiwan's bid.
</P>
<P>
Peter Chang, director of the Bureau of International Cooperation
of the Department of Health, said since the TaiwanIHA's inception
in 2006, it has sent medical delegations to extend aid in more
than 10 disasters, including tsunami- struck areas in South Asia
and the Solomon Islands, a landslide in the Philippines,
earthquake in Indonesia, and flood in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, during its recent trip to the Solomon
Islands,  the boat carrying workers from TaiwanIHA  and other
international humanitarian aid organizations ran aground on the
way to the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite of this and other hazards, Taiwan will not hesitate to
extend its helping hand to other countries in need, Chang
stressed.
