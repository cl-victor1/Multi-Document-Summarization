Taiwan's economy is expected to grow only moderately this year,
as the global economic growth will advance at a slower pace than
last year, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER)
predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CIER researchers forecast that Taiwan's gross domestic product
(DGP) will advance 4.17 percent this year, slightly higher than
the 4.13 percent that was predicted by the institution late last
year, but would be lower than the growth of 4.62 percent posted
for 2006.
</P>
<P>
For 2008, CIER researchers painted a rosier picture, with the DGP
growth topping 4.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
CIER researcher Chou Chi forecast that the 2007 global economic
growth  will be slower  than  last  year,  mainly  due to a
slower-than-expected U.S. domestic economy, which would reflect a
number of negative phenomena, including flat real estate markets.
</P>
<P>
CIER forecast that consumption in the private sector will grow by
2.8 percent this year, up 1.27 percentage points from the 1.53
percent of 2006.
</P>
<P>
Domestic investment is seen to grow by 1.82 percent this year,
marking a modest growth of 0.2 percent over the year-earlier
level, but the substantive domestic investment rate is expected
to stand at a low of 15.44 percent this year -- a level still
considered too low in this regard.
</P>
<P>
CIER researchers predicted that domestic investment and export
trade of goods and services will all gain momentum in the second
half of the year, although private consumption will be unlikely
to grow that briskly.
</P>
<P>
According to a CIER estimate, Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI)
will register an annual growth of 1.25 percent this year, 0.65
percentage points higher than the year-earlier level, mainly as a
result of rising prices of raw materials on the global market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the institution forecast that Taiwan's unemployment
rate in 2007 will be around 3.91 percent, a slight improvement
over the previous year, although the jobless rate is expected to
top 4 percent in the third quarter.
