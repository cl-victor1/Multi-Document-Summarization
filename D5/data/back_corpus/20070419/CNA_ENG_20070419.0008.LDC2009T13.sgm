A tornado hit Tainan County in the early morning hours of
Wednesday, with the wind speeds estimated at up to 102 kilometers
per hour, tearing down at least 10 homes and leaving livestock
dead, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).
</P>
<P>
The tornado occurred at around 1: 40 a.m. and lasted until 2: 09
a.m., bringing strong winds estimated at level 10 on the Beaufort
Scale and heavy rains to the southern county, CWB officials said,
adding that rain accumulation during the duration of tornado
amounted to 30-35 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
The officials said as tornadoes are so unpredictable, the CWB
judged that from the movement of the system on radar screens and
from information provided by the general public that the system
must be a tornado.
</P>
<P>
The real cause of the tornado is still unclear, the officials
said, adding that tornadoes usually occur when super cold front
systems are accompanied by thunder and strong winds. The
officials further said that while tornadoes are not unusual in
Taiwan in the spring and summer, they rarely cause serious
damage.
</P>
<P>
As tornados always carry strong winds which could easily destroy
measurement facilities, it is hard to get reliable measurements
of them, the officials said, adding that the CWB does not have an
observation booth in the area, so it was impossible to measure
the actual level of Wednesday's tornado.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CWB said that a cold front is expected to arrive
in the country on Sunday and that rain is also forecast for the
northern, central, and southern parts of the island.
