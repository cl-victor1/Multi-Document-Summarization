Over 1,000 tea growers from Nantou County in central Taiwan are
slated to stage a protest Friday in front of the Legislative Yuan
against the importation of substandard foreign tea that is
seriously threatening their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Lin Yun-sheng, who will lead some 1,600 tea farmers from
local townships to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan
Friday, said Nantou tea growers want fair competition, but
imported low-end foreign products have ruined the home market.
</P>
<P>
Nantou County is one of Taiwan's major tea production sites, and
its Oolong tea is famous around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to tea farmers from Mingchien township, business losses
have amounted to NT$275 million in recent years after at least
24,000 metric tons of foreign- grown tea were imported into
Taiwan at low customs rates.
</P>
<P>
Apart from their financial losses, they said, these substandard
foreign  goods lack certificates  or labels identifying  their
country-of-origin,  or verifying that they have passed strict
quarantine controls, and so pose a great risk to the health of
Taiwanese consumers.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Tang Huo-shen told a Legislative Yuan news conference
early this week that large amounts of cheap foreign tea are being
imported into Taiwan everyday, packaged as a locally grown
product, and sold on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 25,000 metric tons of tea from China and
Vietnam, along with that of other countries, were imported into
Taiwan. This low-priced foreign tea, after being disguised as
Taiwanese-grown goods, was sold for around NT$350 per kilogram in
the domestic market, according to Tang.
