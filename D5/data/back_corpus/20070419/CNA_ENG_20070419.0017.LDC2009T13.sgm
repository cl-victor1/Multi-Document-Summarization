Taipei,  April 19 (CNA) 04/19/07  16:27:19 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
A report released Thursday by an animal rights organization
claims that more than 70 percent of public slaughterhouses in
Taiwan still kill pigs in a cruel manner.
</P>
<P>
Chu Tzeng-hung, chairman of the Environment and Animal Society of
Taiwan (EAST) , released the findings of the organization's study
of slaughterhouses around the country conducted over a three-year
period dating back to 2004.
</P>
<P>
After watching a video made by the EAST about how Taiwan's
slaughterhouses kill their pigs, several lawmakers from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union promised to propose an amendment to the Animal
Protection Law so as to bring animals raised for economic
purposes under the law's protection.
</P>
<P>
According to Tzeng, only six of the 27 public slaughterhouses
around Taiwan kill their pigs in a humane way, namely by making
the pigs lose consciousness with an electric shock so that they
feel no pain when they are slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
The pigs at the other slaughterhouses are killed in a cruel
manner, Tzeng said, explaining that the pigs are first hung
upside down by one of their legs and then beaten unconscious with
a stick before being slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, several of the woman lawmakers were
brought to tears while watching the video on how cruelly the
animals are treated.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao Bi-khim, a DPP legislator, said that as a ruling party
lawmaker, she feels ashamed that the government has failed to
punish the owners of the slaughterhouses  that treat the animals
so mercilessly. She promised to work with other lawmakers to push
for an amendment to the Animal Protection Law to bring animals
raised for economic purposes under the law's protection.
