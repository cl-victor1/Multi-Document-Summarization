Taipei, April 19 (CNA) 04/19/07  19:30:13 (By Elisa Kao)

<P>
Former Anglican Archbishop of South Africa Desmond Mpilo Tutu met
Thursday with family members of victims of Taiwan's 228 Incident
of 1947 and said forgiveness is the major road to reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Tutu, who became famous during the 1980s as an opponent of
apartheid in South Africa and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1984, arrived in Taipei Wednesday with Alexander Boraine,
founding father of the International Center for Transitional
Justice, for a week-long visit at the invitation of the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
Tutu also visited early Thursday a former execution ground for
political prisoners during the period of Taiwan's martial law and
the 228 Peace Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei, where he met
family members of victims of the 228 Incident, an uprising
against the corrupt Kuomintang (KMT) administration that began
Feb. 28, 1947, which led to the murder of thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Tutu told the families of the victims that he was not here to
"teach" Taiwan how to resolve the disputes and problems resulting
from historical tragedy, but rather to "share" his experiences in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
The method chosen by South Africa was to set up a truth and
reconciliation commission to allow the public to know about the
reality and to face it, Tutu said, adding that he was glad to
hear the stories of the family members of the Taiwanese victims.
</P>
<P>
Noting that unveiling a country's history and memory is an
important beginning, Tutu said allowing the families of the
victims to tell their stories is the best way to heal their pain
and that in the meantime the country can heal society's pain
during the process of pursuing the truth.
</P>
<P>
He said he saw many South African people who suffered persecution
in the past still with anger in their faces and trying to take
revenge. However, Tutu added that he saw gentle faces among the
Taiwanese sufferers, saying that the suffering of these people
brought democracy and human rights to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Boraine noted that South Africa and Taiwan are far
apart geographically  but have similar miserable histories and
therefore have many voices calling for justice.
</P>
<P>
Describing the truth as "bitter as herbal medicine," Boraine said
however that it can bring healing power to the country and that
the process of pursuing the truth can bring hope to the people.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his visit to the 228 Peace Memorial Hall, Tutu left a
note that included the words: "here is acknowledgment of painful
history, pray that their beautiful island will become reconciled
and healed."
</P>
<P>
Tutu, who became the first black person to lead the Anglican
Church in South Africa Sept. 7, 1986, headed the country's Truth
and Reconciliation Commission after the end of apartheid. He has
also contributed significantly to the safeguarding of democracy
and human rights around the world community.
