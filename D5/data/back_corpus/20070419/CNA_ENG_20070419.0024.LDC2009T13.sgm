An aging society study group has concluded a two-day survey in
communities in the southern county of Tainan, with the aim of
investigating the differences in population aging between urban
and rural areas in Taiwan, team members reported Thursday.

<P>
The study group, under the auspices of the National Science
Council, is led by Minister without Portfolio Lin Wan-i.
Researchers from several top universities in Taiwan also
participated in the survey.

Lin said that while people aged over 65 only accounted for 7
percent of Taiwan's population  in 1993,  it will have risen
tremendously to 20 percent by 2025.

The government has already started a 10-year geriatric care plan,
Lin noted, adding that the effectiveness estimate and progress
evaluation provided by the study group will help the government
fine-tune the plan so that it can offer better services.
