NO MORE EMERGENCY DRILLS: NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei, April 19 (CNA) 04/19/07  18:37:23 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
National Taiwan University (NTU) responded positively to an
unannounced emergency response test conducted by two lawmakers on
its campus Wednesday, but will not allow any more such tests by
lawmakers in the school, a university official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fu Li-cheng, secretary-general of the university, pointed out
that the school already has an emergency response mechanism and
was alarmed by Wednesday's shooting rampage at Virginia
Technology University in the United State, which has sisterhood
ties with NTU.
</P>
<P>
Against this background,  Fu said his university was told
Wednesday by Ministry of Education (MOE) official Ker Hui-chen
that a security test might be carried out on its campus at an
unspecified date.
</P>
<P>
In light of the fact that half of the university's security
personnel are contracted workers rather than career police
officers, Fu said his school considered Wednesday's test a good
chance to examine the school's strengths and weaknesses in
maintaining campus security.
</P>
<P>
Fu said his school appreciates the concerns of media and
lawmakers over its security, but had no advance knowledge that
the test had been conceived by the two lawmakers, who made a hoax
call to the police saying that three NTU students had been taken
hostage by gunmen on campus.
</P>
<P>
The official said the lawmakers and police officers who responded
to their hoax call were allowed by university authorities to
enter the school Wednesday, but said the university would refuse
to allow similar tests in the future.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the lawmakers' hoax call, 55 police officers
equipped with rifles and anti-terrorist gear rushed to the
university to handle the purported gunmen, only to be greeted by
a crowd of TV cameramen called in by the two lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, Lee Chen-nan and Lin Kuo-ching of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, apologized Thursday after being
blasted by the media for orchestrating a publicity stunt, fooling
the police and causing panic among students.
</P>
<P>
Ker denied that the MOE played a support role in the two
lawmakers' scheme, claiming that all she knew was that the
lawmakers, who sit on a legislative committee that controls the
ministry's purse strings, wanted to check NTU's security
operations.
