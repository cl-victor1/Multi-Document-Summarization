ENVIRONMENTALISTS WARN AGAINST SOME ENERGY-CONSUMING PROJECTS

If the government approves all major pending development
projects, it would become a menace to the world community,
several members of a task force commissioned to make environment
impact assessment warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Five members of the task force, including Rubin Winkler, Lee
Keng-cheng, Hsu Kuang-jung, Chou Chin-cheng and Chan Shun-kuei
appealed to the Executive Yuan to make that environment a
priority during a news conference. The sixth member, Kuo Hung-yu,
although not present, signed his name to the joint written
statement.
</P>
<P>
Members of the task force asked the Executive Yuan not to
accommodate the wishes of the big enterprises and turn the task
force into a "rubber stamp" that simply endorses development
projects.
</P>
<P>
The task force currently has 21 members comprised of seven
members designated by the government, including the minister and
vice minister of the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA), and 14 scholars and experts.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, in creating US$1 million worth of gross domestic product,
will produce an estimated 8.5 million tons of carbon dioxide,
said the members citing statistics released by the EPA,
</P>
<P>
If several major development projects, including a steel refinery
plant, two thermal power plants and one petrochemical park, all
pass their environmental impact assessments, emissions of carbon
dioxide will surge by 43.44 percent, turning the island into a
menace to the world community, which has demonstrated an ever-
stronger desire to cut emissions of greenhouse gases. q In
addition, water demands associated with major development
projects will also be a problem, they said.
</P>
<P>
An initial estimate shows that water requirements from the
industrial sector will increase by 121.7 tons daily to reach 440
million tons annually, equal to the household consumption of
nearly 5 million people for the year: an amount equal to all the
waters of the Feitsui Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Lee expressed concern that additional water for the Central
Taiwan Science Park is coming from a reservoir which is being
required to cope with the constantly increasing needs of the flat
panel factories, and that as factories are being given priority
irrigation projects are getting recycled waters. This results in
"good water for the industrial sector and poor water for the
agricultural sector," Lee claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chan, concerned about the air quality in central Taiwan, said the
area already hosts a thermal power plant, sixth naphtha cracker
and the Central Taiwan Science Park. If other development
projects, including the Formosa Plastics Group's steel refinery,
also pass environmental impact review, the air quality could
deteriorate to levels that may compromise public health.
