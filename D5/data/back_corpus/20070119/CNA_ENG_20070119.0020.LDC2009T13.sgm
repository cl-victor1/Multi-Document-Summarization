The Taiwan International Health Action (Taiwan IHA) task force
has sent a mission to Kenya to help the African nation control an
outbreak of Rift Valley fever, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak began in October following severe flooding in
East Africa, more than 350 suspected cases of the mosquito-borne
disease had been reported in Kenya as of Jan. 12, more than 130
of which had proved fatal, Taiwan IHA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a call for international relief from the Kenyan
government and the United Nations, the Taiwan IHA dispatched an
advance team to Kenya in December to survey the situation and
sent a nine-member health mission to Kenya Jan. 14, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the mission has demonstrated the use of
pesticide sprayers in areas affected by the disease and has
donated 24,000 mosquito nets for use by local residents, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has also arranged an inspection tour of
Kenya's health facilities for the mission and has expressed hope
for long-term medical and health cooperation with Taiwan, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan IHA is an inter-ministerial task force set up by the
government to take part in international health relief efforts.
