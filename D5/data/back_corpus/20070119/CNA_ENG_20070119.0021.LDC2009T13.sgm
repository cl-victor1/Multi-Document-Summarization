Klaus Rose, a former member of Germany's federal parliament --
the Bundestag -- has recently published a book focusing on Taiwan
and the country's achievements in the promotion of democracy.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony to mark the release of the book, titled "Taiwan -- The
Island's Republic in the Focus of German Politics, " was held at
a Berlin  hotel Wednesday,  which  attracted  nearly  20 German
parliamentarians, as well as media representatives and
sinologists.
</P>
<P>
Rose, who served as a Bundestag member for 28 years before
retiring a year ago, was chairman of a Taiwan-friendly subgroup
in the federal parliament and had visited Taiwan seven times
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Rose writes about his visits to Taiwan and his impressions of the
people. He also details Taiwan's political transformation from
martial law to democracy.

<P>
The book features Rose's meetings in Taipei with former Premier
Sun Yun-suan, former Foreign Affairs Minister Fredrick F. Chien,
former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying- jeou, and President Chen Shui-bian,
as well his analysis  of the cross-Taiwan Strait situation  and
Germany-Taiwan relations in trade, investment, culture and
politics.
</P>
<P>
He also gives European countries 12 proposals on Asian policy and
urges them to expand exchanges with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Rose also claims that it is "not necessary" for Germany to ignore
Taiwan's democratic achievements because of its "one-China"
policy.
