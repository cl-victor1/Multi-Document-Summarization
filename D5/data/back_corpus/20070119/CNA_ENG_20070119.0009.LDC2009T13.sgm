PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE DEFENDS CHIEF OF STAFF'S 'NO SHOW' AT COURT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 19 (CNA) 01/19/07  12:23:07 (By Sofia Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff and four other
Presidential Office staff members are entitled to be absent from
a court hearing in the trial concerning the alleged "special
state affairs fund" misuse scandal, a spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's Public
Affairs Department, said Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to the
President, and four other officials had requested permission not
to attend the court hearing.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, Tan Sun Chen was accompanying Palauan President
Tommy Remengesau on a tour of the southern port city of Kaohsiung
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the request of prosecutors, the Taipei District Court had
asked Tan Sun Chen and four other members of the Presidential
Office staff to testify Friday to shed light on the "state
affairs fund" budgeted for the president's discretionary use.
</P>
<P>
The court wanted to determine whether the five Presidential
Office officials knew anything about the use of the fund, part of
which the president claimed to have been spent on secret
diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
The four other officials were Yu Hsin-ming, director of the
Presidential Office's Second Bureau;  Wu Chien-ping and Hsiao Yi-
chang, section chiefs of the Second Bureau; and Hsieh Chien-tsai,
head of the Political Ethics Department.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office issued a press statement late Thursday
saying that the five officials have a legitimate reasons to be
absent because the questions the judges intend to ask infringe
upon the president's "state secrets privilege" and may also harm
the national interests.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the president's "state secrets privilege" is not
confined to those listed in the existing State Secrets Protection
Law, the press statement said the issues that the court wants the
five officials to give testimony on are unspecific and too broad
in scope while lacking "concrete relevance" with the special
"state affairs fund" case.
</P>
<P>
Providing information about the execution of the president's
official duties in diplomatic, military and national security
domains not only goes against the president's "state secrets
privilege" buy may also jeopardize national security and
interests, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
As the head of state, the president is obligated to defend
national security and interests, and therefore, only the
president himself can determine whether any information related
to his "state secrets privilege" can be provided to the courts,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the statement said, Article 179 of the Criminal
Procedure Law stipulates: "A witness who is or has been a public
official and who is examined on matters which should be kept
secret for official reasons must obtain the permission of the
competent public office or officer, " and permission specified in
the preceding paragraph may be withheld if it is deemed that the
testimony would be harmful to the interests of the state.
</P>
<P>
Out of the respect for the Constitution and the presidential
powers and taking into consideration the possibility that their
testimony would hurt the national interests, the statement said,
the five officials cannot testify in the case.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution authorities have accused President Chen and his wife
of having embezzled public money from the discretionary special
"state affairs fund."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution concluded that the first couple had used 712
receipts  provided by members of the first family and other
individuals to illegally claim reimbursements  totaling NT$14.8
million (US$450,000) from the president's discretionary state
affairs fund between 2002 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
The first lady was indicted Nov. 3 on embezzlement and forgery
charges. Chen himself is immune from prosecution while in office,
but prosecutors claimed that there is sufficient evidence to
pursue similar charges against him after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer-turned-president has denied any wrongdoing. But he
promised that if his wife were to be found guilty in the first
trial, he would immediately resign. "I believe that history will
return justice to me, and the judicial process will clear my
name, " he said in a Nov. 5 televised speech.
