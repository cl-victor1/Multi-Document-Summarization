Taipei, Jan. 19 (CNA) 01/19/07  21:28:54 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is planning to sign an agreement
with its ally, the People First Party (PFP), in the near future
to organize a "KMT-PFP league," the KMT chairman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou revealed the plan at a meeting with KMT grass roots
members  in Hualien County,  eastern Taiwan,  noting that KMT
heavyweights including Legislature Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan have been expecting the formation of
such a league to help maintain the majority of the "pan-blue
alliance" in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Ma stated there has long been a consensus between the two parties
regarding the establishment of the KMT-PFP league owing to the
fact that the KMT and PFP share the same origins.
</P>
<P>
The PFP was founded by James Soong -- a former KMT member -- and
his supporters after his failed independent bid for the
presidency in
</P>
<P>
2000.
</P>
<P>
Ma said a "common nomination" mechanism will be built under the
planned KMT-PFP league to facilitate a join nomination of
candidates for major elections.
