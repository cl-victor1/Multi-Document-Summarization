The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU's) Central

Acting TSU Chairman Lin Chih-chia announced the decision at a

confirmed at a Party Congress meeting slated for Jan. 26.

The TSU began the procedure to choose a new chairman Monday.

Lin said a unanimous agreement was made in the Central Executive
Committee meeting that Huang should get the post.

Huang is vice chairman and secretary general of Taiwan Advocates,
a non-profit foundation founded in December 2001 by Lee as a
"means to continue the process of democratization and
localization" he initiated during his tenure as president.
