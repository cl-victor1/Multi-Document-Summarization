Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin donated blood Friday at a blood
donation center at City Hall in response to a campaign launched
by the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation to ensure a sustained
blood supply for winter.
</P>
<P>
Hau urged municipal officials to support the campaign, saying
that donating blood is healthy and a benevolent act to others.
</P>
<P>
According to a foundation official, blood supplies in Taiwan
become lower in winter,  particularly in January, due to low
temperatures. This is why the foundation kicked off the donation
drive in January -- which has been designated as "blood donation
month," she said.
</P>
<P>
The official called on the public to endorse the foundation's
blood donation drive by following Hau's suit, especially those of
blood type A, supplies of which are especially limited prior to
the Chinese New Year which falls on Feb. 18 this year.
