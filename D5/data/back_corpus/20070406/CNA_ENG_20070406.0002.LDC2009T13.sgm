The government plans to open sports car racing and horse racing
in southern Taiwan to help rev up the region's economic vitality,
an economic planning official said Thursday.

Chang Ching-sen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , said the council is
collaborating with the National Council on Physical Fitness and
Sports (NCPFS) in drafting a comprehensive plan for opening
special competitive sports in central and southern parts of the
island to boost the regional economy.

The plans for opening sports car racing and horse racing will be
unveiled in June as the first step to implementing the new

is likely to be introduced first.
