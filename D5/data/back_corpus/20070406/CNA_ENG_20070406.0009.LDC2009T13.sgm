Taipei, April 6 (CNA) 04/06/07  15:30:38 (By Deborah Kuo)

Eighteen of Taiwan's traditional industries have been targeted
under a government-initiated "mega investment" project aimed at
helping them upgrade their manufacturing structures and know-how
as well as increase output and sales.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has decided to allocate
NT$15 billion (US$454.55 million) this year to initiate plans for
industrial upgrading, under which 18 selected core manufacturing
businesses, including metal and petrochemical processing,
machinery manufacturing, textiles, plastics and
biopharmaceuticals, will be assisted in efforts to integrate
vertically, cooperate across sectors, and explore export markets.
</P>
<P>
Under these plans, Taiwan's traditional manufacturing industries
-- which posted annual output of NT$4.92 trillion in 1995 and
gradually increased to NT$7.2 trillion in 2005 -- are expected to
achieve annual production totalling NT$10.59 trillion by 2015,
MOEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA is pushing for the implementation of these plans given
the challenges and bottlenecks facing the industries as a result
of economic globalization and the impact of the rises of China
and other developing economies, including imbalances in workforce
supply and demand; insufficient engagement in research and
development; and insufficient resources backup from the
government, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The MOEA plans will include efforts to increase subsidies,
improve traditional manufacturing industries' investment
environment, help sharpen traditional manufacturing industries'
international competitiveness and accelerate these industries'
overall growth.
</P>
<P>
To help traditional manufacturing industries upgrade, the MOEA
will also help train skilled workers, including those responsible
for quality control; push for QC verification and product
licensing; help with  research  and  development  of innovative
products  and technologies; provide long-term soft loans; and
help open up markets abroad, the MOEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The 18 traditional manufacturing industries that have been
selected for the upgrading program involve the production of iron
and steel, auto parts, machine tools, mechanical parts and
components, industrial robots, flat panel displaying and
semiconductor equipment, metal  products,  petrochemicals,  LCD
materials, plastics, biopharmaceuticals,  textiles,  glass,
footwear,  health foods, furniture, pulp and paper processing, as
well as printing, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
It is envisaged that with the implementation of these plans,
Taiwan will become one of the three largest machine tool
producers in the world by 2015, the world's third largest bicycle
producer, and one of the top 10 petrochemical producing
countries, the officials said.
