Kaohsiung,  April 6 (CNA) 04/06/07  12:03:52 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
The wreckage of an Army helicopter that crashed into a radio
tower in a remote mountain region in southern Kaohsiung  County
Tuesday  will be re-assembled  to facilitate investigations into
the cause of the crash, military sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
All the debris of the crashed UH-1H chopper from the Army's
Airborne and Special Operations Command (ASPC) has been recovered
and sent back to the Kueijen Army Base in neighboring Tainan
County for re-assembling, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ASPC is scheduled to hold consultation meetings in the next
few days to discuss repair of the damaged radio tower owned by
the police-operated Public Radio System and compensation for
owners of banana ranches destroyed in the crash, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The flight mishap claimed the lives of all the eight Army
officers aboard. Five of the bodies were recovered at the crash
site Tuesday, but rescuers didn't locate the remaining three
until Wednesday noon when they were discovered lodged in the
girders of the radio tower, which the helicopter had collided
with in bad mountain weather.
</P>
<P>
The crashed helicopter's flight recorders, commonly known as
"black boxes, " have also been recovered and turned over to the
investigators looking into the crash.
</P>
<P>
The crashed helicopter was manufactured in 1974.  Under a
cooperation deal with U.S.-based Bell Helicopter, the military's
Aero-Industry Development Center -- the forerunner of the
present-day Aerospace Industry Development Corp. -- has built a
total of 118 UH-1Hs since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Despite the age of the aircraft, Defense Minister Lee Jye said
after the latest flight disaster that the fleet of UH-1H choppers
is still a reliable part of the country's airborne arsenal and
suggested that the cause of Tuesday's crash was most likely bad
weather, rather than the aging aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lee said that all the remaining UH-1Hs have been
grounded for thorough safety checks. He also said a detailed
investigation report about the cause of the crash will be
unveiled at a news conference next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the family of each officer killed in
the crash will receive compensation of at least NT$15 million
(US$453,360).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Army authorities said they are hopeful that the mishap
will inspire a change in the military's arms procurement policy
which tends to give top priority to the Navy's and the Air
Force's arsenal shopping lists.
</P>
<P>
Army sources said the Army already came up with a plan in 1998 to
replace the UH-1Hs with new UH-60/S-70 Black Hawk helicopters
developed by Sikorsky Co., but the plan was later halted because
the local agent of another U.S. manufacturer strongly lobbied for
its helicopter type.
</P>
<P>
The utility helicopter replacement plan has not been resumed
since that time because the Army later decided to give priority
to purchasing new Apache AH-64D assault helicopters. However,
according to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang, the
military has yet to send any budget proposal for purchasing
either new utility helicopters or assault choppers.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Army officials said they hope both legislators and
members of the public will throw greater support behind the
Army's weaponry procurement projects in the future.
