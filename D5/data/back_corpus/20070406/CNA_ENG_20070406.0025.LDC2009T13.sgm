Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the public to keep an eye out for
migrating euploea butterflies as he inspected a migratory route
used by the colorful creatures in Linnei, Yunlin County Friday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su made the remarks during a tour of Yunlin county to
attend a euploea butterfly festival sponsored by Linnei township.
Su, together with Yunlin Country Magistrate Su Chih-feng, also
promoted papaya and other agricultural produce of Linnei township
during the tour.
</P>
<P>
Su later listened to a briefing by Lee Tai-ming, director general
of the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, about protective measures the
bureau has adopted to safeguard the butterflies.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that each year the butterflies pass a section of the
Formosa Freeway in Linnei,  Yunlin county on their northbound
migration route.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has erected protective screens -- 200 meters in length
and 2.5 meters high -- between the Jhushan and Douliou
interchanges, as well as ultraviolet lights along the Linnei
section to guide the butterflies around a heavily trafficked
freeway bridge, all in a bid to preserve the good name of Taiwan
as a butterfly kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials noted that these measures, the first-ever along
freeways in Taiwan to protect butterflies, were implemented at
the suggestion of environmental researchers at I-shou University
in Kaohsiung County.
</P>
<P>
Such large-scale protective measures for migrating butterflies
are very unusual, even in other countries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The premier spoke positively about what he saw, saying "If we
love the beautiful butterflies, we must not harm them."
</P>
<P>
As the weather conditions over the past days have been variable,
the number of the butterflies flying along the route has been
less than expected.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the number of butterflies will peak between
April 14 and April 19, though a further delay is possible.
</P>
<P>
The bureau stated that it has decided that the outer northbound
lane on the Linei section of the freeway it may be temporarily
closed if the average number of euploea butterflies passing over
it exceeds 2,000 per minute.
</P>
<P>
According to previous surveys, at least one million euploea
butterflies migrate every year from northern Taiwan to the south
of the island, wintering near Kaohsiung or Taitung before flying
back north in the spring.
</P>
<P>
The butterflies usually pass over the Linnei freeway section
between mid-March and mid-April. In a single observation period
on April 3, 2005, researchers recorded some 11,500 euploea
butterflies per minute flying over the freeway: the equivalent of
over one million butterflies in a single day.
