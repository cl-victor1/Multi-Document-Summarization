NO-ONE COMES FORWARD FOR KMT CHAIRMANSHIP: PARTY OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA) 02/24/07  20:00:57 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
No-one within the Kuomintang (KMT) has shown any willingness to
run for the party chairman post in a by-election tentatively
slated for mid-April or early May, not even acting Chairman Wu
Po-hsiung, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Den-yih made the comments while answering questions from
reporters amid speculation that Wu Po-hsiung is almost certain to
take part in a planned by- election for the party's top post.
</P>
<P>
"No-one has come forward and displayed interest in running, and
all media reports on the issue are sheer speculation, " Wu Den-
yih said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT is slated to finalize a timetable for the by-election in
the next weekly meeting of its decision-making Central Standing
Committee Feb. 28, Wu Den-yih said, adding that it might be held
in the middle of April or early May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers were mixed in their reaction to media
speculation that Honorary Chairman Lien Chan might assume the
chairmanship or that Wu Po-hsiung might take part in the by-
election.
</P>
<P>
Wu Po-hsiung, the KMT's first vice chairman, took over the post
from former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou earlier this month after Ma
was indicted on corruption charges over alleged misuse of a
special municipal allowance when he served as mayor of Taipei
from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma offered to resign as KMT chairman following his indictment and
immediately announced his bid to participate in the 2008
presidential race, making him a possible opponent of Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is also interested in
representing the KMT in the presidential race. The KMT is
Taiwan's largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
KMT Lawmaker Wu Chih-yang, Wu Po-hsiung's son, categorically
denied the media rumors that his father is gearing up to run for
the party's chair.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chih-yang said that "the top priority for my father now is
building party unity and pushing Ma and Wang to discuss their
presidential rivalry."
</P>
<P>
According to lawmaker Hsu Shu-po, "it would be best" if Lien were
to be handed the KMT chairmanship without having to take part in
the by-election, and he called for KMT members' support for this
idea.
</P>
<P>
Wu Po-hsiung has yet to make public any intention to run for the
KMT chairmanship, and Ma's aides had better not to speculate over
the issue, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wu Yu-shen, a protege of Ma, argued that Lien should
have to run in the by-election in accordance with the party's
mechanism if he is interested in assuming the KMT chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever wants to become KMT chairman must follow the party's
system and get elected through the by-election in line with the
party's reform efforts," he said.
