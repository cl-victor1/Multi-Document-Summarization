PRO-INDEPENDENCE GROUP TO `SEEK TRUTH' THROUGH 228 MEMORIAL EVENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA) 02/24/07  20:24:51 (By Y.F. Low)

The pro-independence Taiwan Society will hold a memorial event on
the eve of the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident with the
theme of "restoring the truth of the tragedy, " an official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 27 event will take place at Taipei's Machangting
Memorial Park -- the site where many victims of the 228 Incident
were executed, said Yang Wen-chia, secretary-general of the
group.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both the government and private sectors have held
various memorial events to mark the incident annually for many
years, Yang claimed that the Taiwan Society will discard the
"sentimental tone" in which such events have been held in the
past and will take a tough stand this year to seek justice on
behalf of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
Yang claimed that a documentary film on the 228 Incident produced
by the Taipei city government during the term of former Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou was an attempt by the former ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to
distort the truth.
</P>
<P>
"This is like rubbing salt into the wounds of the victims'
families,  which has brought  them inexpressible  sadness  and
resentment," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that during the memorial event, his group will try to
represent the bloody atmosphere of 60 years ago through dance and
audio-video effects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, President Chen Shui-bian will erect a monument
condemning the perpetrators at the scene and lead the
participants in performing a ritual symbolizing a crusade for
justice, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the event is "not aimed at stirring up ethnic
conflict but upholding justice."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has accused the
late President Chiang Kai-shek of being the key perpetrator of
the 228 Incident of 1947, in which thousands of people were
massacred by KMT troops suppressing a rebellion against the KMT's
iron-fisted rule of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
To mark the 60th anniversary of the incident, the DPP has put
forth a series of proposals regarding the pursuit of transitional
justice,  including  measures to "eliminate  the remnants  of
authoritarian rule" associated with Chiang, such as removing
military guards posted at Chiang's mausoleum, renaming the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" and
renaming all roads named after Chiang.
