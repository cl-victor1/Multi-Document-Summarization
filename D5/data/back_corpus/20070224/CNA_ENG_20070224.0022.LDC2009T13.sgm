Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) 02/24/07  21:30:49 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Folk singer, writer and producer Ma Chao-chun died at the age of
48 early Saturday after collapsing the previous night.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Cardinal Tien Hospital's Yungho branch in Taipei
County said Ma showed no signs of life when he arrived at the
hospital. Doctors gave up attempts to resuscitate him after
working on him for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
He left behind a wife and three children, the youngest of whom is
just a month old.
</P>
<P>
Ma had a history of high blood pressure  and experienced
difficulty  breathing recently and doctors speculated that the
talented musician, who was overweight, might have died from heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
Ma made his mark early in life. At the tender age of 19, he
became a recording star and a cash cow for recording companies.
</P>
<P>
He reached his zenith in his 20s, when such famous singers like
Teresa Teng, Tracy Huang, Liu Wen-cheng and Fong Fei-fei were
keen on cooperating with him and singing his songs.
</P>
<P>
But the sudden death of his father plunged the talented musician
into depression and he began drinking heavily and using
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
He suffered a further blow when the devastating 9-21 earthquake
in 1999 destroyed his music studio, leaving him heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
After his house in Taichung was auctioned off by the court, he
brought his wife and daughters back to Taipei. In dire financial
straits, he was left at one point with only NT$500 for the whole
family, and had to make the difficult choice of whether to buy
lunchboxes for the grownups or baby formula for the toddler
daughter. The situation inspired him to write "Formula or Bento,"
which appears on his new album.
</P>
<P>
Just when Ma, a devoted Christian in the latter stage of his
life, was almost penniless, he began receiving royalties from
recording companies.
</P>
<P>
Ma served as a goodwill ambassador for a "save the jobless
family" drive launched by an online human resources bank and
convenience store chain earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to help 100,000 people to find employment and expressed
a "love affairs with work" in the Year of the Pig.
</P>
<P>
Ma's wife has decided to hold a memorial service for him,
although the time and location had yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Recording companies also said that they will hold a memorial
concert for him.
</P>
<P>
hito Radio, where Ma worked as a DJ, will broadcast a special
program in his honor.
