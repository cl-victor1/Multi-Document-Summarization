Geneva,   Switzerland,   Feb.   23  (CNA) 02/24/07  14:18:24 (By
Neil Lu and Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's new deputy representative to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) assumed office Friday.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after taking up his new post, Wei Ko-ming
began work on matters concerning the Doha Development Round of
WTO negotiations, which aims to lower trade barriers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a seasoned trade negotiator who once served as deputy head
of the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) , is no stranger to WTO
affairs as he was deeply involved in negotiations for Taiwan's
WTO accession during his tenure as BOFT deputy director.
</P>
<P>
Before  coming to Geneva,  Wei served as Taiwan's  deputy
representative to the European Union and Belgium. During his more
than four years serving in the post, Wei made contributions to
efforts to promote Taiwan's trade and economic relations with the
European Union and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Wei was appointed last September to fill the post left vacant by
John C. Deng, who has been serving as Taiwan's deputy
representative to the United States since late last June.
