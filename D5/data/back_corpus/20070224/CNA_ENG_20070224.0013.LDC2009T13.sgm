Six Taiwan senior high school students have recently gained
admission to Classes Proparatoires aux Grandes Ecoles, a French
preparatory school for the prestigious Les Grandes Ecoles,
Ministry of Education (MOE) officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The students are Lin Chieh-an and Lin Yang-yao from National
Taichung First Senior High School, Lin Pin-ting from Chiayi
Hsing-Hwa Senior High School, Chen Wei-min from Tainan First
Senior High School, Chen Yi-kui from Taipei Municipal Jianguo
High School and Hsieh Cheng-ying from Changhua Senior High
School, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The French Ministry of Education held an examination in Taiwan in
late 2006 to select outstanding senior high school students
wishing to attend the preparatory school, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
They are slated to depart for France in August to attend a
French-language study program first, they added.
</P>
<P>
Their two-year tuition will be funded by the French government,
while the MOE will provide them with round-trip plane tickets.
</P>
<P>
If they gain admission to Les Grandes Ecoles after they finish
the preparatory school courses, 90 percent of their tuition will
be financed by the French government, they added.
