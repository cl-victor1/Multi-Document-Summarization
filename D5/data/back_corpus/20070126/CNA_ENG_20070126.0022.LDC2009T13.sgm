Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan and Chuang Chia-jung made history Friday
by winning second place in the women's doubles in the US$15.68
million Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Chan and Chuang -- who advanced into the semifinals and finals of
the women's doubles as wild cards -- were thwarted by Cara Black
and Liezel Huber of Zimbabwe and South Africa, respectively, 6-4
6-7 6-1, but nevertheless became Taiwan's first grand slam
doubles finalists after trouncing defending champions Yan Zi and
Zheng Jie of China in the semifinals a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
They finished off the pair of American Ashley Harkleroad and
Galina Voskoboeva from Russia 6-0 6-0 in the quarter-finals in a
quick 26-minute contest with nearly perfect play and no unforced
errors.

On Friday, Black and Huber leapt to a set in hand and a 4-2 lead.
But after Black had her serve broken while serving for the match
at 6-5, Chan, 17 and Chuang, 21 came back strongly in a
tiebreaker to level the match. However, their inexperience on the
big stage came to the fore and they lost five games on the trot
in the decider before Black sealed victory.

<P>
Chan and Chuang, dubbed the "Hope of Taiwan" by the local press,
won a silver medal in the women's doubles in last year's Doha
Asian Games.
