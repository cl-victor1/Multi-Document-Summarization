OPEN TB PATIENTS TO BE BANNED FROM LONG-HAUL FLIGHTS: CDC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei,  Jan. 26 (CNA) 01/26/07  19:49:56 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Open tuberculosis patients will be banned from long-haul flights
from September at the earliest, the Center for Disease Control
(CDC) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials  said TB is the top killer  among Taiwan's
communicable diseases. It is estimated there are an average of
between 15,000 and 16,000 new TB cases a year, with the number of
fatalities nearing 1,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
Acting on an advisory from the World Health Organization on
travel for TB patients, the center decided to impose the
restriction on them.
</P>
<P>
Sufferers will be prohibited from international flights of more
than eight hours, the officials said, noting that the disease
poses great danger to other passengers in the close confines of a
flight cabin.
</P>
<P>
CDC Director Kuo Hsu-sung said that under the center's 10-year
project to cut the number of TB sufferers by half, prevention of
the spread of the disease is crucial and the question of human
rights violations should not be considered.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said the CDC has notified local health authorities that they
should publish related regulated procedures by July this year.
</P>
<P>
The CDC will also work with the Immigration Agency to list TB
sufferers, based on the same approach it took to stem the SARS
outbreak in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Kuo noted that after July, doctors will advise open TB cases that
they will face fines if they are caught taking long-haul flights.
</P>
<P>
The CDC will also disseminate the news on coaches servicing
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
After the ban is put in place, open TB patients will be
intercepted before departure. They will have to receive treatment
for at least two weeks prior to travel to make sure they are not
communicable before being allowed to leave the country, or face
fines of up to NT$150,000 (US$4,550).
</P>
<P>
The CDC estimated that around 6,000 open TB patients and between
500 and 700 patients who are resistant to drug therapy will be
affected by the ban.
