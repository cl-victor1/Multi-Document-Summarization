Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng released a public letter to
parents nationwide Friday, urging them to help their children
foster the healthy habit of exercising.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, publicized on the ministry's Web site, Tu
suggested that the parents pay attention to their children's
exercise habits, reminding them that the winter break is a good
time for kids to foster the habit of getting regular exercise.
</P>
<P>
In the letter titled "Promising Kids a Healthy and Happy Future,"
Tu urged parents to train their children during the nearly one-
month break to do exercise at least 30 minutes everyday and to
try to create a health-oriented dining environment at home.
</P>
<P>
Tu has been enthusiastic in pushing people to exercise regularly.
In early January, his ministry worked out a "happy living"
program in the hopes of making "sports" a part of students'
homework.
</P>
<P>
Tu cited in his letter "worrisome" data that shows there were
around 3 million students in the country in 2005 who did not have
the habit of exercising and that half of all students were not in
good shape.
</P>
<P>
"The figures show Taiwan students are facing a crisis of health,"
Tu warned.
