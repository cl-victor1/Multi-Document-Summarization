Sales of health and cosmetic products grew by double-digits last
year in Taiwan, with cosmetics for men expanding by 30-40
precent, according to the drugstore chain Watson's.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hui-hsiao, the company's procurement director, reported
Thursday that its health food market increased by 15 percent,
which she claimed shows that Taiwan consumers now attach great
importance to the quality of life and products as the society
ages.

<P>
Japan's health product market is the most mature in Asia, Lee
said, adding that Taiwan is catching up with Japan in this aspect
as local consumers' health awareness increases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rapid sales growth of men's cosmetics indicates
that Taiwanese men care about their health and looks, according
to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Watson's saw increases in sales of special purpose
products, such as toothpastes for sensitive teeth or shampoos
that have special effects, which shows that Taiwan consumers have
a better understanding of product functions, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that Taiwan's elderly population is estimated to reach
60 percent in 2036, a level similar to that of Japan. However,
currently, there are not many international health product brands
on the market, she added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's health product industry produces quality
products and has a huge potential for future development due to
its strength in biopharmaceutical technology, Lee said Taiwan
lacks marketing and market experiences, which she said can be
improved by the importation of more international brands.
