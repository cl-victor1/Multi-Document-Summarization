NO HURRY FOR NEW CONSTITUTION: KMT OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, Jan. 26 (CNA) 01/26/07  21:27:36 (By Flor Wang)

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is not opposed to writing a
new constitution for Taiwan, but the issue should be decided by
new public mandate, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said earlier
the same day in an international forum that conditions are ripe
for crafting a new constitution for the nation, and that Taiwan
would not become a normal, complete and progressive democracy
without a timely and tailor-made constitution.
</P>
<P>
Wu replied that there is no need to hurry to create a new
Constitution as a new legislature is to be produced in December
this year, and a new president will be elected in March next
year.
</P>
<P>
It is much more important to pursue law and order in compliance
with the existing constitution than to create a new one,
particularly as the current Republic of China Constitution has
been amended seven times, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu further claimed that no one would expect Chen would abide by a
new constitution judging from his past performance, and that the
president now lacks public support and confidence to promote a
new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Writing a new Constitution would probably elicit concern from the
United States and lead to conflict in the Taiwan Strait, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to opposition People First Party (PFP) spokesman Lee
Hung-chun, Chen has now made mention of a new constitution only
to shift public attention away from his alleged role in the high-
profile scandal relating to improper reimbursements from the
Presidential Office's special state affairs fund, and to provoke
tension across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lee accused Chen of risking national security and the people's
well-being by rehashing the constitution issue for personal ends.
</P>
<P>
The KMT, the PFP and the New Party form the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" against the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.
