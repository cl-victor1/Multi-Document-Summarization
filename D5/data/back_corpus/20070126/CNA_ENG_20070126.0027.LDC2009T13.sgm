PRESIDENT PROPOSES POLITICAL CONSULTATIONS TO RECLAIM KMT ASSETS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  26 (CNA) 01/26/07  18:37:18 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian proposed Friday that the country seek to
enact a law through political consultations to reclaim assets
allegedly embezzled by the former ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , as
part of efforts to address the issue of transitional justice.
</P>
<P>
Chen raised the proposal while taking part in a discussion on
"transitional justice" during a Taipei conference aimed at paving
the way for the formation of his "Global Forum on New
Democracies."
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that over the past two decades, most emerging
democratic nations  have completed  their transformation  from
authoritarianism to democracy through bloodless revolutions.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a few dictators who were stripped of their
political power, most old political groups still play important
roles in the political scenes of these countries, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"The complexity and difficulty in dealing with the problem of
transitional justice tend to increase when the people's support
for and opposition to authoritarian rule are based on their
divided ethnic or national identity and even different religious
beliefs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the 228 Incident of 1947 in which thousands were
killed in Taiwan by KMT troops suppressing a rebellion against
KMT rule, the president noted that the KMT first denied the
existence of the incident altogether and then tried to obscure
the truth and distort its nature into a simple "conflict between
the people and the police."
</P>
<P>
As the persecutors were not investigated and none were punished,
the rifts and wounds caused by the incident have never really
healed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also participating in Friday's discussion, former El Salvadoran
President Francisco Flores said his country has adopted several
important steps in the process of democratization, which include
enacting an amnesty law, setting up a truth investigation
committee and establishing a mechanism allowing rival parties to
set up ceasefires to allow for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While former militia leaders have been allowed to join politics,
political interference has been removed from the military so that
the people's lives are no longer subject to disturbance by the
secret police, Flores said.
</P>
<P>
On the experience of South Korea, former South Korean President
Kim Young Sam said his country took immediate action to crack
down on corruption involving the former military regime as soon
as the democratic government was formed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, South Korea has established rule of law to replace
military rule, adopted a transparent policymaking  process to
eliminate corruption and set up a market mechanism to facilitate
fair competition, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former South African President Frederik Willem de
Klerk said the new South African government has established a
truth and reconciliation committee to monitor the process of
democratic transformation.
</P>
<P>
However, as the committee does not include representatives of the
former ruling party, it has failed to achieve true reconciliation
between the conflicting parties, de Klerk said.
