Taipei,  Jan. 26 (CNA) 01/26/07  18:36:02 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said
Friday that he will step down from the party's top post if
indicted on embezzlement charges over his alleged misuse of a
special mayoral discretionary fund while serving as mayor of
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Ma made the remarks while answering questions from party members
at a local committee meeting in northern Hsinchu City. Ma stepped
down from the Taipei mayoral post in December last year after
finishing two four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he would resign from the post as the KMT requires if
he were prosecuted, Ma said that he did not feel that he was "set
up" by anyone else and that it is important to maintain party
discipline.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he is confident of winning the 2008 presidential
election, Ma said that he is determined to transform the KMT into
a clean political party and seek the chance to serve the country.
</P>
<P>
If elected,  Ma said,  the KMT will not advocate  Taiwan
independence but instead will try to improve Taiwan's relations
with China and build peace in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, he would also step up economic cooperation with
China to sharpen Taiwan's economic competitiveness in the face of
strong foreign competition at a time when the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations is slated to form a free trade economic
zone in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan must collaborate with China as China is emerging as a
power in the Asia- Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely reported that the prosecution will soon
conclude a probe of the case regarding Ma's special mayoral
allowance before Chinese New Year, which falls this year on Feb.
18.
