Some 160 elementary school students from the eastern  county of
Yilan who toiled for four months in experimental rice paddies,
donated their harvest Friday to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
The fifth and sixth-graders from the Hsiao Wei Elementary School
in Yilan's Wuchieh rural township passed out 570 kg of rice --
packed in 170 bags that were harvested last July -- to the Hsiao
Wei village head's office in a human chain.
</P>
<P>
The village head's office will distribute the rice to low-income
families in the area.
</P>
<P>
Under a "Neo-Agriculture Movement" launched by the Council of
Agriculture, the 160 "little farmers" from the Hsiao Wei
Elementary School took part in the rice farming between March and
July last year, learning how to cultivate rice sprouts, plant out
seedlings, water, apply fertilizer and harvest.
</P>
<P>
School principal Lin Chi-sheng said the activity has not only
helped the children learn about the hardships suffered by rice
farmers but has also turned trivial personal gains into "great
compassion" of humans to other people.
