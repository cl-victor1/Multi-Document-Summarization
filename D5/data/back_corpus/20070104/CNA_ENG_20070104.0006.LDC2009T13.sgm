Incoming passengers have been prohibited from bringing any live
animals, plants or related products into Taiwan since the
beginning of this year, customs officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan approved late last year a new list of live
animals, plants and relevant products that are prohibited from
being brought into the country by individual passengers for the
sake of protecting the local ecology, preventing epidemics and
promoting public health, the officials said, adding that the list
of banned items came into effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
The off-limits list includes live animals and related products
with the exception of dogs, cats and rabbits that comply with
provisions of the animal disease prevention and control law as
well as dried or processed aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Also on the list are live plants and related products as well as
fresh fruit, but plants that meet the flora epidemic prevention
and control regulations are exempted from the ban.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials said passengers intending to bring permissible
animals, plants and relevant products into Taiwan should honestly
fill in the customs declaration forms and have their articles
inspected at special inspection desks upon their arrival at the
country's main gateways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said it will install
more trash bins at airports to encourage incoming passengers to
voluntarily dispose of contraband animals, plants and relevant
products.
</P>
<P>
COA officials also urged airline companies and travel agencies to
step up an awareness campaign to help passengers better
understand the country's new entry regulations for disease
prevention and ecological protection purposes.
