The Ministry of Education (MOE) is joining forces with other
government agencies and sports associations to help boost the
Kaohsiung city government's bid for the right to host the 2011
Summer Universiade, an MOE official said Thursday.

Ho Chuo-fei, director-general of the MOE's Department of Physical
Education, told CNA that a Taiwan delegation comprised of
government officials headed by Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng
will travel to the Italian city of Turin to attend an executive
meeting of the International University Sports Federation (FISU)
slated for Jan. 16.

Other members of the delegation will include Chen Chuan-show,
chairman of the National Council for Physical Fitness and Sports,
Lee Tien-jen,  president  of the Chinese Taipei University
Sports Federation (CTUSF) , and officials from the MOE's
Department of Physical Education and the Kaohsiung city
government, Ho said.

Noting that the FISU will select the host city for the 2011
Summer Universiade during the meeting, Ho said the Taiwan
delegates will deliver briefings to FISU members to solicit their
support for Kaoshiung's bid.

Ho further said Tu will head for the United Kingdom Jan. 6 to
attend an international meeting of education ministers scheduled
for Jan. 8-10 and will then travel to Italy to join the Taiwan
delegation.

Meanwhile, CTUSF Secretary-General Wei Hsiang-ming said the
delegates will do their utmost to get Kaohsiung selected,
although he admitted it will be a difficult task.

According to Wei, this is the third time a Taiwan city will have
bid for the right to host the World University Games.

Kaohsiung has been selected by the FISU as one of the five
official candidate cities to host the 2011 event. The other four
candidates are Shenzhen in China, Kazan in Russia, Poznan in
