It remains uncertain whether President Chen Shui-bian will attend
the Jan.  10 inauguration of Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel
Ortega, Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ministry is still making arrangements and a final
decision will not be announced until all arrangements have been
settled, Huang said media speculation about the possibility of
Chen making transit stops in major U.S. cities on his way to and
back from Nicaragua has caused many troubles and confusions.
</P>
<P>
Huang said media reports about Chen's overseas travel plan do not
exactly comply with facts and realities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a MOFA official said the ministry has yet to make a
final decision on whether Chen should attend Ortega's
inauguration in person or not because the situation remains
unclear. If Chen will indeed travel to Nicaragua to attend
Ortega's inauguration, the official said, "simplicity" or "ease"
will be the key principle in arranging his itinerary.
