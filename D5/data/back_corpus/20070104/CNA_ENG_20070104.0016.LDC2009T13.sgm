Taipei,  Jan.  4 (CNA) 01/04/07  15:59:16 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is opening 10,000 night-shift
jobs in the industrial manufacturing sector for foreign laborers
starting January, Taiwan's top official in charge of labor
affairs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said to help alleviate labor shortages
in that sector, the council has decided to allow some 10,000
foreign laborers to work evenings in factories this year,
following last year's creation of 20,000 jobs for foreign workers
in the local industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks during a visit to three high-technology
companies in Hsinchu Science Park to gain a better understanding
of labor shortages in Taiwan's "Silicon Valley."
</P>
<P>
Lee said the government has imposed few restrictions on the
hiring of high- caliber or skilled workers in the high-technology
manufacturing sector -- ruling only that potential job applicants
from abroad should be university graduates with at least two
years of work experience.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, Lee said, Taiwan's high-technology companies
should have no problems recruiting skilled workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
According  to Liu  Yueh-chun,  a spokesman  for  Powerchip
Semiconductor Corp. (PSC) -- one of the three high-technology
companies that Lee visited Thursday -- the PSC group will create
1,577 job openings this year after it struck an agreement with
the Japanese Elpida Memory Inc. to establish a joint facility in
central Taiwan for DRAM production.
</P>
<P>
The PSC group will need an additional 1,500 workers every year
for the following three years, Liu added.
