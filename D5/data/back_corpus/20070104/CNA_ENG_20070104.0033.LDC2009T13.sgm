The operations of the Taiwan high speed railway system is not
expected to have a marked impact on the air travel market in
central Taiwan, a spokesman at Chingchuankang airport in central
Taichung county said Thursday.

Judging from flight bookings, the north-south bullet train system
has not noticeably impacted the aviation market in central Taiwan
since it began Tuesday to sell tickets for trial operations from
Jan. 5-14, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only two aviation companies -- UNI Airways Corp. and
Mandarin Airlines -- operate flights from and to Chingchuankang
airport, he said, adding that except for southern regions, the
two carriers ply several daily flights to the rest of the
country, including northern Taipei, eastern Hualien and the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Air travel in central Taiwan has been hit hard since the Taichung
airport was relocated from near the city center to Chingchuankang
in nearby Taichung county, he pointed out, adding that carriers
have been seeking to open new routes from Chingchuankang airport
to overseas destinations or some of the other outlying islands to
mitigate the adverse effects of the relocation.
