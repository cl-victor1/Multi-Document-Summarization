FORMER DPP HEAD CALLS FOR NEW DRIVE TO DENOUNCE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 3 (CNA) 03/03/07  20:39:21 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh
said Saturday that he will renew a campaign to denounce
corruption-tainted President Chen Shui-bian and called for
widespread support for the cause from academics, judges, lawyers
and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Shih, leader of massive anti-corruption demonstrations against
Chen from September to October last year in front of the
Presidential Office, issued the call at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Shih, Chen's "influence peddling" in the legislative
and judicial systems over his alleged role in the case related to
false reimbursements from his "special state affairs fund, " in
which his wife and four others have been indicted, has posed a
serious violation of the government system.
</P>
<P>
Shih pointed out that Chen intervened when prosecutors summoned
Presidential Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen for questioning in
the case by instructing the top aide not to attend the court
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
A president who has "betrayed" the government must not be
protected under the special treatment of presidential criminal
immunity, Shih argued.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Chen must be condemned for what he described as
"treason against the country,"  Shih said that he will launch a
new campaign to denounce Chen as long as more than 500 lawyers,
prosecutors and academics are willing to rally behind him to help
the judicial system from being interfered with.
</P>
<P>
Wei Chien-fung, a volunteer lawyer for Shih's "red-clad" protests
against Chen last year, said that he will contact legal
organizations in the coming days and will seek the endorsement of
more than 500 lawyers to back Shih's cause.
