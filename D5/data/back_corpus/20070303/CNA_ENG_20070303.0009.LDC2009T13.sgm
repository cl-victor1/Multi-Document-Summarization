Taipei,  March  3 (CNA) 03/03/07  12:28:27 (By Sofia Wu)

The first group of local bullet train drivers will join the
service in May, a spokesman for the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, 12 local drivers will complete their
training courses in April and will be able to start driving the
trains in May as the company has decided to increase the number
of round trips on the railway by the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
The company now has 37 foreign train drivers and is scheduled to
add six more later this month, as the last section of the railway
has already gone into service, the spokesman said, adding that it
has also recruited a total of 62 local train drivers for
intensive training.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Banciao section of the bullet train went into service
Friday, linking the capital with major central and southern
cities.
</P>
<P>
Commercial runs of the high speed railway were launched Jan. 5
between Taipei County's Banciao in the north and Zuoying,
Kaohsiung City in the south, marking the first export of Japan's
bullet train technology.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei-Banciao service was delayed pending a separate
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The first bullet train from Taipei departed at 6:50 a.m. Friday
for the 345-km journey and arrived 100 minutes later, the THSRC
spokesman said. The train has a top speed of 300 kilometers an
hour.
</P>
<P>
The government has high expectations about the economic benefits
of the bullet train service, which will cut three hours off the
previous four-and-a-half-hour train journey between Taipei and
Kaohsiung, the country's two largest cities.
</P>
<P>
The THSRC now runs 19 round trips a day and hopes to eventually
increase to 88 trips, with the system capable of handling 100
million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
The rail system will be managed by the THSRC for 35 years, after
which it will be turned over to state control under the terms of
the build-operate-transfer formula.
