HK DENIES ENTRY TO FORMER MAC CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>

Hong  Kong,  Aug.  11  (CNA) (By Stanley Cheung and Wendy Chung)
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has officially
rejected former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-
yuh's visa application amid continued tensions between both sides of
the Taiwan Strait, sources revealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang was invited to attend an academic conference at the University
of Hong Kong, where he was scheduled to jointly chair the opening
ceremony on Thursday with Ip Kwok-wah, special assistant to HKSAR
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
</P>
<P>
Fredrick Fung, general education coordinator for the university,
confirmed to CNA that Hong Kong immigration officials notified him
Monday that Chang's visa request had been denied.
</P>
<P>
Fung said the conference, slated to take place on Thursday and Friday
evenings, originally invited specialists from Taiwan, Hong Kong and
mainland China to address the topic of China's reunification, with
university students from Hong Kong, Beijing and the United States
attending as well.
</P>
<P>
Because Chang is not able to take part, however, the first day's
seminar had to be canceled at the last minute, Fung said. He added
that this was regrettable, as this would have been a rare opportunity
for experts from three sides to discuss the reunification issue.
</P>
<P>
Due to tense relations between both sides of the strait, Fung said
that if the "central government" has instructed the HKSAR to bar the
former MAC chairman's entry, he has "nothing to say."
</P>
<P>
But if it were the special administrative region's own decision, it is
another matter, he said. He pointed out that Hong Kong is a "special
region" that can play an intermediary role in private cross-strait
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, Chang has already retired from his government
post, which means his status should not be a matter of sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
Chang was allowed to visit Hong Kong while still in office last May on
a "personal visit."
</P>
<P>
In response to outside speculation, a Hong Kong Immigration Department
spokesman simply said that as a matter of policy, they do not comment
on individual cases.
