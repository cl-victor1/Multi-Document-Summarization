HOG TRACEABILITY SYSTEM TO BE IN PLACE BY JUNE: CABINET SPOKESMAN

Taipei,   Feb.  15  (CNA) 02/15/07  12:12:52 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
A hog traceability system will be introduced by the end of June
as part of the government's efforts to prevent sick and dead hogs
from being illegally processed into edible pork products, Cabinet
spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang gave the directive after a Council of
Agriculture (COA) official delivered a report on stepping up
supervision of pork production to ensure food sanitation at a
weekly Cabinet meeting the day before, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, the premier also ordered the COA to flesh out
measures for stricter control of sick and dead hogs, including
encouraging hog farmers to join a national hog insurance program
to secure compensation in the event of the death of their hogs.
</P>
<P>
With consumers getting increasingly critical of food quality and
hygiene, Premier Su said relevant government agencies should
initiate new measures and new systems to streamline management of
farm produce production and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Su also said that a farm produce traceability system should be
introduced and promoted throughout the country, according to
Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other farm products, it should be easier to
implement a traceability system for hogs, Su said, adding that
technical details for implementing the system should be in place
by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Su said that under the new system, each package of pork products
should have a label explaining where the hog was reared, as well
as information about the farm and the breed.
</P>
<P>
According to COA tallies, Taiwan produces about 9 million hogs
annually. To strengthen management, Su said the hog insurance
system should be expanded to cover as many hogs as possible.
</P>
<P>
The COA has come up with a plan to set up a special fund, with
money provided by hog farmers and relevant government agencies,
to subsidize farmers in case their insured hogs die. The subsidy
may reach about 70 percent of the market price of the dead hog.
</P>
<P>
According to a COA plan, the current hog insurance program will
be expanded to cover up to 5.7 million hogs raised in 18 cities
and counties around the island by the end of this year. In the
future, COA officials said, all of the hogs raised in the country
will be covered by the insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the premier asked law enforcement authorities to speed
up investigations into suspicious trade in sick and dead hogs and
bring to justice all those involved. Unscrupulous dealers should
be harshly punished and fined, while areas where relatively large
quantities of suspicious pork products have been uncovered should
be listed for intensified monitoring and crackdown, Su said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of sick and dead hogs being sold on the market has
drawn the public's attention after substandard pork products were
uncovered in certain southern counties earlier this month. Key
government agencies have reached an agreement to list sick and
dead hogs as waste subject to stringent regulation.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Administration is working on a set
of rules to better govern the disposal of sick and dead hogs. For
its part, the COA will coordinate with county and city
governments to establish an orderly hog production and sale
system. And the Department of Health will step up its crackdown
on illegal pork processing plants, inspections on downstream pork
vendors and probes into the sources of suspicious  meat products
used for human consumption.
