PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW TO SERVE AT HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, Feb. 15 (CNA) 02/15/07  16:31:34 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, orthopedic surgeon Chao
Chien-ming, will serve at SinLau Hospital's Matou branch starting
March 1, the hospital announced Thursday at a news conference in
Tainan County, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
SinLau Hospital superintendent Chuang Ming-hsiung said at the
news conference that Chao hopes for a fresh start and that the
board of directors of the hospital only agreed to hire him after
he vowed to serve "with a spirit of voluntarism" by donating his
entire salary to charity.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said that Chao first talked with hospital officials on
January 18 but that he did not touch on the subject of serving at
the hospital during that talk. Later,  Rev. Kao Chun-ming, former
president of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan,  served as a go-
between, and the hospital learned of Chao's intention of serving
patients in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Rev. Kao said that when he first met with Chao, he was at his
lowest point in life because of the insider trading scandal.
</P>
<P>
Kao said that as a Christian, he wanted to extend a helping hand
to others. He added that he was also deeply moved by Chao's
aspiration to help people in need in remote areas and therefore
began actively working to help Chao achieve his goal.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said that Chao will donate his entire salary to charity,
but the hospital has yet to determine how much to pay him and
what organization or organizations the money should be given to.
</P>
<P>
The superintendent denied that the government has offered him the
post of Department of Health minister in exchange for inviting
Chao to work at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Chuang said that he was once indeed interested in politics but
that he has lost "the zest for it" in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has dealt directly with Chao concerning his request
to work there, and no one at the Presidential Office or in the
first family has been involved in the hiring, Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
Chao was not present at Thursday's news conference. Instead, a
written statement in which he expressed his appreciation to the
hospital for allowing him to work there was read at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Chao also asked that he be allowed to carry out
his work of helping patients at the hospital without being
hounded by members of the media.
</P>
<P>
Chao recently resigned from National Taiwan University Hospital
(NTUH) , with the resignation taking effect Wednesday. He was
suspended from duty by the hospital immediately after he was
indicted in July 2006 on charges of insider trading of Taiwan
Development Corp. (TDC) stocks.
</P>
<P>
NTUH voted down Chao's request to return to his job last October
on the grounds that he had "seriously violated medical ethics."
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Court sentenced Chao to six years in prison
and fined him NT$30 million  (US$909,090)  in December  after
determining that he had taken advantage of his influence to
obtain important information regarding TDC share prices, based
upon which he traded TDC shares for huge profits.
</P>
<P>
Chao has appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court.
