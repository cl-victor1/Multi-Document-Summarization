Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA) 02/15/07  21:21:01 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's crude (unadjusted by age) death rate from suicide grew
by 0.7 percent or 4,000 people last year, marking the first
decline in a decade in this regard, the National Suicide
Prevention Center (NSPC) under the Department of Health (DOH)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the growth of 23 percent posted during the 2004-2005
period, the 0.7 percent growth figure posted in 2006 was
massively relieved, said Hsu Ching- hsin, a department chief of
the DOH Bureau of Medical Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The growth figure stood at 15 percent 10 years ago, according to
tallies compiled by the DOH.
</P>
<P>
The country's crude death rate from suicide hit an all-time high
of 18.8 per 100,000 people in 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to DOH tallies, suicide was the ninth most frequent
cause of death in Taiwan in 2005, with crude mortality surpassing
the previous record of 18.73 persons per 100,000 recorded in
1964.
</P>
<P>
Since the NSPC was inaugurated in January 2005, local hospitals
and clinics have been required to report every attempted suicide
case.
</P>
<P>
Crude mortality from suicide also declined in Keeling City,
Taoyuan County, Changhua County and Kaohsiung City since the four
cities and counties were selected for enforced suicide-prevention
efforts, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that some people, particularly depressives or people who
live alone, can be suicidal on special days such as Valentine's
Day, Christmas or New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some 40 percent of suicidal people send out messages
before their suicide attempts, Hsu called for the public to help
prevent suicides during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.
