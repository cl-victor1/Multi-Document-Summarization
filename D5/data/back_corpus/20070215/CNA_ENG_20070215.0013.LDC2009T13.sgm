Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/15/07  16:04:29 (By Y.F. Low)

President Chen Shui-bian has no plan to mediate among the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential aspirants
before the registration period for the party's primary ends, a
Presidential Office official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Cho Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, it is impossible for the president to do
anything before that date, because there is no way to know who
will be vying for the party's nomination until then.
</P>
<P>
Cho said recent newspaper reports about President Chen trying to
dissuade certain aspirants from joining the race are based merely
on speculation.
</P>
<P>
A local daily reported Thursday that Chen has tried to dissuade
Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun from
running for the presidency  in 2008 in an effort to "simplify"
the presidential competition within the DPP.
</P>
<P>
It said Chen is trying to reduce the number of DPP contenders to
just two, namely former Premier Frank Hsieh and incumbent Premier
Su Tseng-chang, and has offered to arrange some other positions
for Lu and Yu in exchange for them agreeing not to run.
</P>
<P>
Lu,  Yu, Hsieh and Su are widely seen as "the four DPP
heavyweights" who are likely to compete to represent the party in
the next presidential election, but none of them has publicly
announced their decision to join the race.
</P>
<P>
Both Lu and Yu have denied having discussed the issue with the
president.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable for the presidential primary finalized
by the DPP's Central Standing Committee Wednesday, registration
for the primary will be open from March 5-9.
</P>
<P>
A vote by party members is scheduled for May 6, while opinion
polls on the support ratings of the contenders will be conducted
from May 7-28. The outcome of the primary is slated to be
announced May 30.
