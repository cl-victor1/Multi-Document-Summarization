EX-KMT HEAD'S PRESIDENTIAL BID REFLECTS 'DOUBLE STANDARD':
PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/15/07  15:59:42 (By Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang accused former opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying- jeou of adopting a "double standard" in how he
is dealing with his own corruption charges and those against
first lady Wu Shu-jen.
</P>
<P>
Su was commenting on Ma's announcement, immediately after being
charged with corruption Tuesday, of his bid to run for the
presidency in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Su pointed out that Ma demanded that President Chen Shui-bian
step down when Wu was charged with corruption and forgery in
November 2006 for alleged misuse of the president's "state
affairs fund, " a case in which Chen was named as a "joint
perpetrator" but not charged because he currently enjoys
presidential immunity from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
However, contrary to what Ma has demanded of Chen, Ma is now
making a bid for the presidency while facing similar charges, Su
said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption center of the Taiwan High Court Prosecutor's
Office indicted Ma Tuesday on corruption charges after
determining that he embezzled NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from
a special allowance fund designated for his discretionary use
during his two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
While resigning from the KMT chairmanship immediately after the
indictment, Ma claimed that he is innocent and announced his
decision to run for the presidency in 2008 to prove his integrity
"via voter support" in the election.
</P>
<P>
Ma claimed he had no intention of breaking the law because he
considered the fund set aside for his discretionary use as
"private money, " as it is regarded by every other recipient of
similar funds in Taiwan.
