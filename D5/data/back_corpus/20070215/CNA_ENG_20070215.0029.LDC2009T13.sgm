PUBLIC OPINION REFLECTS RISING TAIWANESE IDENTITY: MAC REPORT

Taipei, Feb. 15 (CNA) 02/15/07  19:55:55 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Public opinion showed a rise in expressions of Taiwanese identity
in the nation in 2006, according to a report released Thursday by
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).
</P>
<P>
After analyzing all public surveys carried out in 2006 in Taiwan
on issues concerning cross-Taiwan Strait relations, MAC
researchers come up with the following four conclusions: the
Taiwan people support the idea of promoting cross-strait
exchanges in the fields of trade and investment in a prudent
manner; public opinion reflects a growing Taiwanese identity; the
Taiwan people hope that Beijing will conduct negotiations and
talks with the Taiwan government; and the Taiwan people strongly
agree that government should take steps to expand Taiwan's role
in the international community.
</P>
<P>
The report was compiled by the MAC from the results of 49 public
surveys conducted by 15 different poll centers around the island.
</P>
<P>
On questions concerning Taiwan independence or unification with
China, all of the surveys show that most respondents favor the
idea of maintaining the status quo, the MAC said.
</P>
<P>
Most survey respondents oppose unification as described in
Taiwan's now shelved Guidelines for National Unification, as well
as China's "one country, two systems" policy, and believe that
Taiwan's future should be decided by the people of Taiwan, the
MAC said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of cross-strait trade and investment, the MAC said the
survey results show that Taiwanese people do not believe the
country has benefited from Taiwanese investment in China and
think the government should impose stricter restrictions on
investment in China.
</P>
<P>
While most survey respondents  expressed  support  for the
government' s "active management, effective opening" policy
regarding cross-strait trade and investment, they also support
the notion that the government should reinforce its management of
such exchanges, with national interests the guiding principle,
the MAC said.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of cross-strait negotiations, the MAC said most of
the respondents believe Beijing's decision to make contact with
Taiwan's private sector but keep "open lines of communication"
with the government will affect the general interests of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MAC said the surveys show that the public do not agree with
Beijing's attempt to deny the existence of Taiwan's government
and that opposition political parties cannot take the place of
the government  in dealing with problems derived from cross-
strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Only through government-to-government channels can the national
interests and rights of Taiwan be properly secured, the MAC
claimed.
