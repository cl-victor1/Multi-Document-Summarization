KMT HONORARY CHAIR TO HELP COORDINATE CHOICE OF 2008 PARTY
CANDIDATE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA) 02/15/07  11:03:15 (By Sofia Wu)

Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) honorary Chairman Lien Chan will
host a meeting Friday to help arrive at a consensus among all
aspirants contending to be the party's candidate in the 2008
presidential election, party sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Early efforts to come to an agreement on the party's presidential
ticket grew urgent after former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
announced his presidential bid and resigned as KMT chairman
following his indictment on corruption charges Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lien said earlier in the day that Ma's hasty announcement of his
presidential bid may "narrow" the maneuvering room available in
attempting to coordinate with another party kingpin --
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a former mayor of Taipei, has been seen as the front-runner
in the 2008 race. His indictment over the alleged
misappropriation of public funds during his mayoral term has
dealt a serious blow to the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Party sources now say the best hope for the party to win the 2008
presidential election is for Ma to make peace with his bitter
political rival.
</P>
<P>
Ma beat Wang in a contest for the party's chairmanship election
in 2005 by painting his rival as corrupt, but Tuesday's charges
have undermined Ma's once formidable "Mr. Clean" image.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Wang resented the accusations, which may have
stoked his interest in opposing Ma in the KMT's presidential
selection process, or perhaps even have encouraged him to
consider running as an independent in the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Through KMT acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung's intensive contacts,
Wang and Ma have accepted Lien's invitation to a meeting at
Lien's office Friday morning, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the sources said it remains unclear how Lien would push for
Wang and Ma to team up -- forming a Wang-Ma ticket or a Ma-Wang
ticket -- or to come to terms on other options.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Wang has assumed a low profile since
Ma's announcement of his presidential bid. Wang said earlier in
the day that he feels no rush to announce his future plans. "I
think I still have much time to review all variables before
coming to a decision," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Wang said joining the presidential race remains
Wang's top priority.
