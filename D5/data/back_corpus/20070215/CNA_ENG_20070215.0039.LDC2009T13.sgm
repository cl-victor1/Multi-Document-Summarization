LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER QUESTIONS KMT CHARTER REVISION PLAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA) 02/15/07  22:42:43 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) kingpin reminded the party
Thursday that the people's feelings should be taken into account
when the party mulls a plan to revise its charter so that the
party can nominate criminals convicted in their first and second
trials and that only when convicted in a third trial will such
criminals be banned from being nominated by the party to run for
elected office.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who has a keen interest
in seeking the main opposition party's nomination for the 2008
presidential election, made the comments after it was widely
reported that the KMT is considering amending its charter to
allow for nomination of indicted former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to
run for the 2008 presidency.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the KMT will advance its party congress
to early June to carry out the revision through due process by
lowering the threshold to ban only "those convicted in a third
trial" from being nominated by the party to run for elected
office.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted Tuesday on corruption charges over his alleged
mishandling of a special allowance fund earmarked for his
discretionary use during his tenure as Taipei mayor from
1998-2006.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the KMT must not ignore the people's negative
response to its sudden charter shift, Wang claimed that the party
would have no future and is doomed to fail should it make people
feel it is "embarking on the road of moral degeneration."
</P>
<P>
"How could people continue supporting the KMT if it is unable to
touch their hearts? " Wang asked, urging the party to "maintain a
high level of moral standards" and "maintain the public's strong
confidence in it."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would consider forming a Wang-Ma or Ma-Wang
ticket to represent the KMT in the next presidential election,
Wang said it is "too early" to talk about the issue but called
for sincere unity among party members.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he has yet to make a final decision on whether he will
run in the 2008 presidential election and made it clear that the
decision will not be made anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih denied the report
that the KMT is softening its stance regarding indicted members
wishing to run for public office, but he acknowledged that many
of the KMT's rank-and-file members and Central Standing Committee
members support a charter modification to help party candidates
avoid what they called "political interference from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party."
</P>
<P>
KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng, however, backed the charter revisions,
claiming that it would be a change to help protect KMT candidates
in the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Wu, one of Ma's proteges who once served as a core aide to Ma
when the former KMT chairman served as mayor of Taipei from 1998
to 2006, claimed that the proposal "is by no means aimed at
bailing out Ma. It is a measure to protect KMT members from
politically charged prosecution by the DPP."
</P>
<P>
Wu made the claim at the Legislative Yuan at a time when the KMT
has come under fire for customizing its rules to guarantee Ma's
right to participate in the party's presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
In view of a foreseeable fierce competition in December's
legislative polls, it is necessary to implement the charter
modification to secure the KMT's survival, Wu contended, pointing
out that "the revision still needs to be discussed by more than
1,000 party delegates in the June national congress."
</P>
<P>
"The party needs to hear the voices of its members first before
making a final decision on the issue after it has gained an
understanding of public opinion," he said.
