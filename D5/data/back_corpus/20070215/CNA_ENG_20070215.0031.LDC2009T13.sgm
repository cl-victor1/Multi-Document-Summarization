PRESIDENT MUST PAY DAMAGES FOR UNSUPPORTED CLAIM: COURT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA) 02/15/07  20:12:56 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
Taipei District Court ruled Thursday that President Chen Shui-
bian must pay opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong
NT$3 million (US$91,183)  in damages and apologize in newspapers
for his allegation that Soong met secretly with China's State
Council Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen Yunlin in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The court said the president failed to carry out necessary
verification before making his allegation.
</P>
<P>
"The president exercises overall control over the executive
sector resources and his responsibility to verify information
must be weighted," a court spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
PFP spokesman Lee Hung-Chun called the judgment "comforting" but
said it came too late. "It took more than a year for the first
judgment to come out," he said, adding that this meant the public
did not get the chance to learn the truth during a time when the
political situation was changing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Chen's counsel said he will appeal to the High Court.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed in an interview with a cable TV channel in May 2005
that Soong met Chen Yunlin in the United States in February that
year.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that his remarks were based on "intelligence," Chen also
said Soong promised  during the meeting to oppose a proposed
constitutional amendment that would allow for popular referendums
on future constitutional amendments, in exchange for Beijing's
approval for Soong to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Soong filed a defamation suit against Chen in June 2005,
demanding a symbolic NT$1 in compensation and a published apology
in four major local newspapers for three consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
After Chen repeated his claim in another TV interview in October
that same year, Soong extended his compensation demand to NT$50
million and asked Chen to publish an apology in four
internationally famous newspapers in the United States, the
United Kingdom, France and Japan, as well as in three local ones.
</P>
<P>
According  to the written  judgment,  Chen said that  the
intelligence about Soong's activity was submitted to him by
Bureau of Investigation Director- General Yeh Cherng-maw.
However, Yeh told the court that he had warned Chen that the
intelligence, some of which he admitted was drawn from media
speculation, was difficult to check.
</P>
<P>
The judgment said that as president, Chen must have understood
the weakness of the information and could have ordered the
national security system to conduct further verification, but
decided not to bother.
