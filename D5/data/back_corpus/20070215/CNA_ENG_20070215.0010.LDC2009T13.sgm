The number of traffic police will be doubled to maintain road
safety and keep traffic flowing during the Chinese New Year
holidays as the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) forecasts a 40-percent increase in the number of travelers
using Taiwan's roadways during the holiday period, an official of
the Naitonal Police Agency (NPA) said Thursday.

<P>
According to the NPA's transportation affairs department, a total
of 10,241 traffic police officers and 2,959 volunteer traffic
police will be dispatched on roadways around Taiwan between Feb.
17-25.

Meanwhile, police will step up measures and crack down on traffic
violators at scenic spots, main connecting roadways and major
bottleneck spots on highways around the island to keep traffic
moving along during peak travel periods during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
The MOTC also announced that a special "traffic conditions
hotline" will be set up, with traffic police around the island
reporting several times a day on the latest traffic situation in
their respective jurisdictions.

<P>
Meanwhile, the NPA urged anyone planning on taking a road trip
during the holiday period to listen to the Police Radio Station
to get the latest update on the traffic conditions along their
planned route before setting off.
</P>
<P>
The NPA also asked members of the general public to use the
special toll-free hotline, at 080000123, to report any heavy
traffic congestion they encounter while traveling in order to
assist police in their efforts to keep traffic flowing smoothly
during the holiday period.
