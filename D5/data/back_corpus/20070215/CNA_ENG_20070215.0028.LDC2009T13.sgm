The supply of pork in the first half of this year should be more
than adequate, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said that the results of the latest census, which
was conducted last November, show that hog farmers could provide
4.78 million hogs in the first half the year, indicating that
there will be an ample supply of pork.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that there were 12,671 hog farmers at the
end of last November, down 2.3 percent from the same month in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of hogs totaled 7.09 million, down 1.4 percent year-
on-year. On average, each operation raised 560 hogs.
</P>
<P>
The COA said that the survey showed that six counties south of
Changhua are the major areas to rear the hogs -- Pingtung County,
Yunlin County, Changhua County, Tainan County, Kaohsiung County
and Chiayi County. The number of hogs raised in the six counties
account for 83.1 percent of national hog production.
</P>
<P>
The COA said that the census also included black hogs whose meat
is preferred among local people. The census also showed that 90
percent of the hogs raised by 5,587 hog farmers, or 44.1 percent
of all hog farmers, were black hogs.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed the number of black hogs is now 1.06
million, accounting for 15 percent of the hogs around the island,
and that operations raising black hogs tend to work on a smaller
scale.
</P>
<P>
The census also queried hog farmers about their intentions to
raise hogs in the first part of the year, with the result showing
that 85 percent of them said that they would maintain their
present level, 10 percent said that they are willing to cut the
number, and three percent said they are willing to increase the
number.
</P>
<P>
The COA said that with the rise in the price of feed on the
international market the cost of raising hogs has also risen,
suggesting that hog growers not to increase the number of hogs,
and should adopt a limited growth strategy to maintain hog price
and ensure profitability.
