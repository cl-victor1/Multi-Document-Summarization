LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER NOT APPROACHED OVER KMT PRESIDENTIAL TICKET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  21:39:36 (By Flor Wang)

Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , said Monday that he has not been invited by
the camp of former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to join him on the
ticket in the 2008 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the comments while answering questions from reporters
on the issue after former premier Frank Hsieh emerged a day
earlier as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's presidential
candidate following the vote of party members in the primary.
</P>
<P>
As Ma was officially nominated last week by the KMT to be its
presidential candidate, Hsieh is expected to compete with Ma in
the next presidential poll. Ma has repeatedly said that he would
first ask Wang to team up with him if nominated by the party -- a
promise that he made to Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and KMT
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung early this year.
</P>
<P>
"But not one of Ma's aides has approached me and invited me to
serve as Ma's running mate, not even just relaying a message, "
Wang said and refused to answer hypothetic questions on whether
he would accept Ma's invitation.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposed Ma-Wang presidential  ticket to
represent the KMT in the coming presidential election, Taichung
Mayor Jason Hu of the KMT opined that the two men's own plans
should be fully respected, regardless of mounting pressure from
the DPP after three of Hsieh's rivals in the primary called for
party unity against the KMT following his win.
</P>
<P>
"I hereby express my best wishes to the DPP, but pressure should
not be shifted to Wang in such circumstances," Hu said. He went
on to express his conviction that "Wang, as a loyal KMT member,
will not do anything that could impair the party, " and that
"endless speculation will only hurt Wang," he said.
