The Lotos Mongolian song and dance group, which comes from the
Republic of Kalmykia, will embark on a performance tour to
provide Taiwanese audiences with a rare glimpse of this European
nation, organizers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Kalmyk group will stage six free-of-charge performances of
its "White Lotus in the Steppe" tour in Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan,
Taipei, Kaohsiung and Hualien from May 9 - 13, main organizer
Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said.

<P>
Kalmykia, a country with a population of 300,000, is situated on
the northwestern shores of the Caspian Sea. Its cultural has been
strongly influenced by Mongolia and Russia, being a constituent
of the Russian Federation but populated by decedents of nomadic
Mongol herdsmen.

"The shoulder-shivering, horse-riding and eagle-flying gestures
in the dance are very Mongolian, while the footwork is obviously
from Kazakhstan, " said organizer Peter Yu, who has extensively
researched Mongolian history.
</P>
<P>
"The throaty aria and traditional dombra, used to accompany
dances, are also from Mongolia, " Yu added.
</P>
<P>
Kalmykia is the only Buddhist nation in Europe and reveres the
Dalai Lama. As Tibetan Buddhism is its dominant religion, the
country is unique in the Russian Federation, most of which is
Orthodox Christian.
