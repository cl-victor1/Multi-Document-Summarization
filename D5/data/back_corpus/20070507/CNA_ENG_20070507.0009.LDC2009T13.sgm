CBC GOVERNOR SUGGESTS INCLUSION OF NT$ IN ASIAN CURRENCY BASKET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  14:20:20 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Taiwan's representative to the on-going 40th annual meeting of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) board of governors in Kyoto,
Japan suggested Monday that the regional bank include the New
Taiwan dollar in working to develop a common Asian currency unit,
a Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) source said that same
day.
</P>
<P>
CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan suggested in his speech delivered at
the ADB governors' meeting that the New Taiwan dollar be included
in the basket of Asian currencies to be used in developing the
proposed common unit given that it is one of the most
representative currencies in the Asia-Pacific region and that
Taiwan is one of the strongest economic and financial powerhouses
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Perng described the Asian currency unit initiative as a good
idea, saying that once it is created, the currency unit can be
used as an index to gauge the fluctuations of major Asian
currencies against other major currencies beyond the region.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the Asian currency unit can serve to
stabilize currency exchange rates in the region, according to the
source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Perng urged ADB member countries to concertedly work
to build a regional currency exchange rate adjustment mechanism
as quickly as possible to secure the stability of Asian
currencies and their face values.
</P>
<P>
Perng also called for the establishment of a regional financial
aid and preparation mechanism to enable ADB members to help one
another when financial crises arise, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The CBC governor further said that as in the past several years,
he is attending the ADB board meeting under protest for the ADB's
unilateral decision to change Taiwan's formal title in the ADB
from the Republic of China to "Taipei, China" in 1986, when China
was admitted to the organization.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan was one of the founding members of the ADB and
has faithfully fulfilled its obligations, he reiterated that
member countries should respect one another and that every member
country is entitled to fair treatment and equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 representatives from around the region have gathered
to take part in the annual meeting, being held at the Kyoto
International Conference Center May 4-7.
