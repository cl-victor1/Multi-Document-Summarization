PREMIER CALLS ON SPEAKER FOR EARLY PASSAGE OF 2007 NATIONAL
BUDGET
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  18:23:54 (By Lilian Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang called on Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng Monday to push for an early passage of the 2007 budget
for the central government.
</P>
<P>
Su, who announced his withdrawal from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential primary Sunday after
losing the first phase -- a member vote -- to his predecessor
Frank Hsieh, also discussed several priority bills with Wang,
including a military procurement bill, a national pension bill
and the amendments to Organic Law on the National Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The 2007 central government budget, which should have been passed
in late 2006, is still pending in the legislature due to
obstruction by the main political parties, which are at
loggerheads over whether the Organic Law of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) should be addressed before the central budget.
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) wants the CEC law discussed
first, while the DPP wants the budget bill discussed as priority.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Executive Yuan will invite the
chiefs of 25 cities and counties for a meeting Tuesday to appeal
for the early passage of the 2007 budget.
</P>
<P>
The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said
the central government has appropriated  around NT$140 billion
(US$4.24 billion) in subsides for local governments for 2007 and
that the local governments have listed them in their budgets,
while the long delay in the legislature will add difficulty in
pushing for administrative work.
</P>
<P>
The DPP also published a TV ad Monday accusing the KMT of holding
the passage of the central government budget hostage to the
Organic Law of the CEC.
</P>
<P>
Acting DPP Chairman Trong Chai noted that as the public is
demanding a referendum  on whether the KMT should return its ill-
gotten assets, if the KMT- initiated Organic Law of the CEC
clears the legislature, the lineup of the CEC will be formed
based on the number of seats of each party, which would allow the
KMT to block any national referendum on its assets to be held in
coincidence with the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung also said the party will
mobilize voters to encircle the legislature to protest against
the long delay of the government budget.
