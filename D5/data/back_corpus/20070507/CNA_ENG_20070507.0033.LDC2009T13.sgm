PRESIDENT DISMISSES REPORTS ABOUT LAME DUCK PRESIDENCY

Taipei,  May 7 (CNA) 05/07/07  20:08:43 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that he hopes to serve a
role that will assist, accommodate and integrate the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party in the 2008 presidential election,
but added that he will never "dictate what others should do."
</P>
<P>
The president also said he will not be a "lame duck" president
now that former Premier Frank Hsieh is set to become the
presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in the 2008 election after winning the first phase of the
primary Sunday -- a vote by party members.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential Office will not shut down, " Chen said, adding
that "there are still many things to do and the role of the
president cannot be stopped or disrupted for one day."
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while receiving the four contenders in the
first phase of the DPP presidential primary -- Hsieh, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Vice President Annette
Lu -- at the Presidential Office. Chiou I-jen, secretary-general
to the Presidential Office, was also present.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all four aspirants signed an agreement prior to the
primary that they would not engage in illegal campaigning, would
not break away from the party even after defeat and would throw
their full support behind the winner, Chen expressed his
admiration for Su, Yu and Lu for honoring their words. Hsieh led
with 44.66 percent of the votes, followed by Su, who garnered 33
percent. The other two were far behind and all three had
withdrawn from the running by early Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has been rife that Su was Chen's favorite among the
four, and some quarters said Su's defeat can be construed as the
declining sway of the president and that he is fast becoming a
lame duck before his stepdown in May 2008.
</P>
<P>
The president dismissed the reports, saying that he "had never
played the president card to try to sway the outcome of any
elections."
</P>
<P>
He said he has taken the high ground and maintained his
impartiality, although he admitted that "it is sometimes hard for
others to believe my words."
</P>
<P>
The president also told Hsieh that the challenges ahead will be
daunting and that the main opposition Kuomintang "is still a
formidable force."
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou, a former KMT chairman who has been nominated as the
party's presidential candidate, is a strong contender, the
president said, adding that all will have to unite in the coming
10 months to pursue success in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Lu, Yu and Su, saying that the trio have ample
experience from past elections and could be of great assistance
to Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
"The 2008 presidential election will be a tough battle, " Chen
said, adding that the challenges will come from inside as well as
outside, especially China.
</P>
<P>
The pressure from China on Taiwan in the next four years will not
be any less daunting than over the past eight years, he
predicted.
