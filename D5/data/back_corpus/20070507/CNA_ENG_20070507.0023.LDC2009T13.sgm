Washington, May 6 (CNA) 05/07/07  18:41:26 (By Jorge Liu and

<P>
The Republic of Kiribati's relations with Taiwan are solid and
the people of Kiribati are grateful to Taiwan for its generous
aid in various fields, Kiribati President Anote Tong said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tong made the remarks in an interview with CNA in Washington,
D.C. where he arrived the previous day to attend the eighth
Pacific Island Conference of Leaders scheduled to open Monday.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is satisfied with the aid programs provided by the
Taiwan government, Tong said Kiribati feels immense gratitude
toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tong said he decided to forge diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 2003
when the latter began offering aid to his country in forms such
as an agricultural development program, a plan for medical and
health care cooperation, and cooperative fishery ties.
</P>
<P>
In less than four years, these efforts have borne fruit, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Taiwan's bid for membership of the World Health
Organization (WHO) in the name of Taiwan, Tong said it is unfair
and wrong to keep Taiwan out of the world's health care system.
</P>
<P>
Kiribati will give all-out support for Taiwan's WHO bid, as well
its other efforts to join international organizations, Tong said.
</P>
<P>
He also invited President Chen Shui-bian to visit Kiribati, an
island nation located in the central Pacific Ocean.
