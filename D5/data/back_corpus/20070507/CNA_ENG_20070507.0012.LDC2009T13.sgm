The four contenders in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential primary met in a gesture of "grand unity"
Monday, one day after the primary vote.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at the DPP headquarters, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, who lost to former Premier Frank Hsieh by garnering
only 33.4 percent of the vote, said he announced his withdrawal
from the primary just hours after the vote in order to live up to
President Chen Shui-bian's expectation that all of the DPP
hopefuls demonstrate unity.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPP is a party of systems and tradition and a
party which treasures unity as its top core value, Su said that
his withdrawal announcement and those of the two other contenders
who lost in the primary vote are meant to allow Hsieh and the
party to embark on an early start on its way toward victory in
the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hsieh, who garnered 44.66 percent of the vote,
first expressed his gratitude to the other three contenders --
Su, Vice President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- for
their respective announcements to withdraw from the party's
primary for the sake of Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh told his three former rivals and members of the media that
he will try his utmost to help the DPP win in the 2008 race and
that afterwards, he will deliver on his promises by implementing
a series of reforms to bring about a "rebirth of the country."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he will not let his DPP comrades and the people of
Taiwan down if he is elected the next president.
</P>
<P>
Lu and Yu also offered their congratulations to Hsieh for his
victory in the primary vote and promised Hsieh that they will
throw their full support behind him to help him win the 2008 race
and allow the DPP to stay in power.
