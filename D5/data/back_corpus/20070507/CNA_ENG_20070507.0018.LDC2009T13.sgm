'FIVE CONVICTIONS' OF ARMED FORCES REDUCED TO THREE
</HEADLINE>

Defense Minister Lee Jye admitted Monday that the "five
convictions" that have been followed by members of the country's
armed forces as spiritual and behavior guidance have been reduced
to three.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the legislative Defense Committee, Lee said
that of the "five convictions" -- doctrine, leadership, nation,
responsibility  and honor -- the notions  of "doctrine"  and
"leadership" have been omitted as times have changed.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Kuo-hsiang, chief of the General Political Warfare
Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense, who was also
present at the question-and- answer session, said the omission is
still under discussion and that no conclusion in this regard has
yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that according to the late President Chiang Kai-shek's
directives, the convictions of "doctrine" and "leadership" could
be omitted once the country implemented the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Opposition New Party Legislator Wu Cheng-dian, elected from the
frontline island of Kinmen, accused the Defense Ministry of
devoting 70 percent of its time and energy to politics and only
30 percent to military management.
</P>
<P>
He urged Lee to steer the armed forces clear of politics and keep
the military politically neutral.
