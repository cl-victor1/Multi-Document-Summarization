OPAQUE PROCESS FOR BUYOUT HURTS TAIWAN: U.S. BUSINESS GROUP
</HEADLINE>

Washington,  April 29 (CNA) 04/29/07  19:46:52 (By Michelle Tsai

A U.S. business group claimed Sunday that Taiwan's lengthy delays
and lack of formal process for leveraged buyout deals hurts
Taiwan chip companies.
</P>
<P>
In a press release posted on its Website Sunday, the U.S.-Taiwan
Business Council, which is dedicated to fostering trade and
business relations between the United States and Taiwan, said
Taiwan's government should set up a thorough, transparent, and
straightforward process for mergers and acquisitions in Taiwan's
semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
The lack of a permanent and timely process for reviewing mergers
and acquisition activity in the chip sector adds costs that may
inhibit foreign investment from even exploring Taiwan's market,
according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the council said, it leads to delays that may
ultimately cause deals to collapse -- a contributing factor in
the recently scuppered plan by U.S.-based Carlyle Group to buy
out Kaohsiung, Taiwan-based chip packager Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering (ASE).
</P>
<P>
Carlyle offered to buy ASE for NT$39 per share in November, 2006,
but called off the bid early this month over the failure to
clench a deal with the ASE.
</P>
<P>
Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council said that increased merger and acquisition activity in
the semiconductor industry would have a positive impact on the
overall value of Taiwan's economy as well as increasing the
capital available to companies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the semiconductor sector is a jewel in Taiwan's
economic crown, Hammond-Chambers warned that legacy policies on
chip investment in China, and the lack of formal processes for
merger and acquisition activities in the sector are set to
undermine the efforts of Taiwanese companies to become industry
leaders through partnerships with global capital.
