PRESIDENT LODGES PROTEST AT WHO OVER TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, April 29 (CNA) 04/29/07  16:11:52 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian lodged "a protest in the strongest
terms" against the secretariat of the World Health Organization
(WHO) Sunday, saying that Taiwan's bid to join the WHO is not an
issue that could be denied or decided by the secretariat or any
individual working for the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Taking the former East Germany as an example, Chen said whether
Taiwan should be admitted into the WHO as a full member is an
issue that should be determined by all member countries of the
WHO.
</P>
<P>
Chen appealed to the WHO Secretariat and WHO Director-General
Margaret Chan to handle Taiwan's accession bid in accordance with
the WHO laws and spirit and refer Taiwan's membership application
to the World Health Assembly so that all WHO members can discuss
the issue and reach a decision when they meet in mid- May.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call in his speech at the opening of a workshop on
Taiwan's bid to join the WHO under the name of Taiwan, marking
the first and formal response to the WHO Secretariat's reply to
his letter dated April 11 to the WHO director- general about
Taiwan's membership bid.
</P>
<P>
The WHO Secretariat responded in an April 25 letter to Chen by
calling Taiwan's application a "non-issue" and saying that after
a thorough study and legal consultation, the WHO had decided not
to deal further with the issue, on the grounds that Taiwan is
ineligible to apply for membership, which requires statehood
recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that Taiwan is a sovereign state which
has every right to apply to join the world health regulatory body
as a full member based on the WHO's spirit of protecting the
health of all peoples around the world and the notion that
medical care knows no borders.
</P>
<P>
Noting that asking for a WHO membership is the exercise of
collective human rights of the 23 million Taiwanese people, Chen
asserted that this is not a matter that could be unilaterally
denied or deprived of by the WHO Secretariat or the WHO director-
general.
</P>
<P>
Chen quoted the WHO's organizational law as indicating that the
WHO's membership is open to all countries from around the world.
He added that the procedural rules of the World Health Assembly
(WHA) -- the WHO's highest decision-making unit -- have also
stipulated that countries intending to apply for membership in
the WHO should submit its application to the WHO chief 30 days
before the convening of the next WHA and the WHO chief should
then refer the application to the WHA so that the application
could be put on the WHA agenda for debate by all member
countries.
</P>
<P>
He argued that whether Taiwan is a sovereign state and whether
Taiwan is entitled to applying for a full WHO membership are
issues that should not be decided unilaterally by the WHO
Secretariat but rather be determined in concert by all WHO member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Based on the WHA procedural rules, Chen said it is the WHO
chief's duty and responsibility that after he or she receives a
membership application, 30 days before a new round of the WHA,
that the application be placed on the WHA agenda for debate -- a
job that should never be handled solely by the WHO Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
It is beyond question that Taiwan is a sovereign state, Chen
stated, adding that Taiwan maintains formal diplomatic relations
with 23 WHO member countries and one WHO observer.
</P>
<P>
On what basis could the WHO Secretariat have denied Taiwan's
sovereign status by saying that Taiwan is ineligible to apply for
membership, and how on earth could the WHO Secretariat cast doubt
on the political decisions that 23 WHO member countries have made
concerning Taiwan, Chen questioned, ridiculing the decision.
</P>
<P>
He lamented that Taiwan's bids to enter the WHA as an observer
have all failed over the past 10 years due to China's
obstruction, thus the country's efforts to "meaningfully
participate" in WHO activities have also been frustrated as a
result of a memorandum of understanding struck secretly between
China and the WHO authorities in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The president  stressed  that Taiwan will only incur more
suppression and humiliation if the country fails to work to
defend its rights or continues to restrict itself on the global
arena and it is the reason why he has insisted that Taiwan
applies for a full membership in the WHO under the name of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan is not the only country in the world which is not
a U.N. member state but tries to gain accession into the WHO,
adding that in 1968, the then East Germany was not a U.N. member,
but it became  a WHO full  member  that year after  the then  WHO
director-general asked to include East Germany's application into
the WHA agenda, with an attachment of the WHO Charter and the WHA
rules of procedure to serve as the reference of all other WHO
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that Taiwan is not challenging the WHO Charter or
the WHA rules of procedure, adding that Taiwan is just asking the
WHO Secretariat and the WHO chief to allow Taiwan's application
to be included on the agenda of the next WHA so that all WHO
member countries could debate it and come to their own decision.
