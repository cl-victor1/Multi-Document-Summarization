China's open policy toward Taiwan, announced in a forum between
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Taiwan-based Kuomintang
(KMT) in Beijing, was greeted with cold shoulder in Taiwan
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Notable among Beijing's announcement was the opening of six more
destinations, namely Chendu in Sichuan Province, Nanjing in
Jiangsu Province,  Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, Shenzhen in
Guangdon Province, Dalian in Liaonin Province and Guilin in
Guangxi Province, for direct charter flights to and fro Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan's Minister of Transportation and Communications
Tsai Duei said that no direct charter flights between Taiwan and
these six destinations could be launched without the approval of
Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said the announcement made by Beijing at the CPC-KMT forum
which was not attended by Taiwan officials is not going to be
translated into Taiwan's policy automatically before negotiations
were held and agreement was reached between Beijing and Taipei,
Tsai said.

<P>
China's another remarkable announcement  Sunday that Taiwan
colleges and universities which are plagued by the scarcity of
students will be allow to recruit students from mainland China
will turn out to be another pie in the sky unless it get the
endorsement from the Taiwan authorities, according Liu Chao-
hsuan, president of Soochow University in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Much as local universities and colleges like to recruit talented
students from China, Liu, who also serves as the president of the
Association of Private Universities and Colleges, Taiwan,
Republic of China, said the government has to acknowledge
diplomas issued by Chinese schools before mainland Chinese
students could enroll in Taiwan schools.
</P>
<P>
Vice Education Minister Lu Mu-lin referred journalists who asked
for his ministry's comment on the issue to the Mainland Affairs
Council saying it is within that council's authorities to decide
whether local schools may take in students from China.
