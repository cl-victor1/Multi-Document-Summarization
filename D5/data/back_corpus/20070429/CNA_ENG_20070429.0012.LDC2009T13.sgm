The number of inbound visitors reached 881,292 in the first
quarter of this year, marking a 2.59 percent year-on-year
increase, according to statistics released by the Tourism Bureau
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained the top source of visitors to Taiwan, while the
number of passengers from South Korea posted the largest growth,
Tourism Bureau officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese people made 306,898 visits to Taiwan in the first three
months of the year, up 4.21 percent, according to the official
tallies.
</P>
<P>
In March alone, the number of visitors from Japan hit a new
single-month high of 120,599, up 10.18 percent from the year-
earlier level. Moreover, both business travelers and leisure
travelers registered solid gains during the month, the officials
said without providing exact figures.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the upbeat records to a combination of factors,
including the practice of many Japanese companies to organize
tours for their employees in March -- the final month of the
traditional Japanese fiscal year; a number of festive activities,
such as colorful lantern exhibitions, held throughout Taiwan
during the month; and an increase of flights offered between the
two countries in March.
</P>
<P>
Another encouraging development during the first quarter of the
year was a 16.58 percent year-on-year growth in the number of
visitors from South Korea, the officials said, adding that the
annual growth rate even reached 27 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
South Koreans made 63,521 visits to Taiwan during the first
quarter, according to the Tourism Bureau tallies. In March alone,
9,528 South Koreans made sightseeing trips to Taiwan, up 66
percent from a year ago. The steep increase might be attributable
to Lantern Festival and tourism promotional  activities launched
by noted Taiwanese pop group F4, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the number of South Korean business travelers during
the same month decreased 5.75 percent to 6,129, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
During  the first quarter,  the number  of visitors  from China-
controlled areas of Hong Kong and Macau also registered a rare
decline of 5.48 percent to 95,451, while the number of American
visitors rose 2.21 percent to 92,648.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of visitors from Singapore surged 7.15
percent to 37,982 and the number of Malaysian visitors also
increased 4.97 percent to 28,668.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the number of visitors from European
countries posted a 6.48 percent growth to 45,706, while the
number of visitors from Australia and New Zealand jumped 10.34
percent to 13,740.
</P>
<P>
According to a Tourism Bureau analysis, the number of tourists or
leisure travelers to Taiwan from its major tourist markets
totaled 372,653 in the January-March period, up 5.74 percent from
the year-earlier level, but the number of business travelers from
its major trading partners slid 3.68 percent to 228,436.
