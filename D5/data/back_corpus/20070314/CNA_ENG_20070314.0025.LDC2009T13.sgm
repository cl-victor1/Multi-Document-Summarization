The relocation of two state-owned enterprises is still under
assessment and they will not be moved south this year, Minister
of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said there is no timetable for relocating Taiwan Power Co.
and CPC Corp., Taiwan -- the only two state-owned enterprises
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs that are headquartered in
Taipei -- but that the move will be impossible this year. If the
ministry decides to relocate, it will make the announcement at
least a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while fielding questions at a legislative
committee in which the issue of whether to relocate the two
enterprises became a focus of debate.
</P>
<P>
Chen promised that the relocation will be considered from the
perspective of professionalism and business.
</P>
<P>
"No other things will be factored in and the ministry is not
under any pressure from a superior authority, " Chen said, adding
that the ministry will respect the final assessment of the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that both Taipower and the CPC are national
enterprises. Taking the CPC as an example, it has a staff of more
than 14,000, of which most are already based in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
From the point of view of economic efficiency, a relocation of
the CPC southwards might have only a limited effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that Taipower and the CPC have in the past made
great contributions to the overall development of central and
southern Taiwan and that they will continue these contributions
through investment.
</P>
<P>
He added that encouraging private manufacturers to invest in
central and southern Taiwan will be most helpful in bringing
prosperity to the region and that the ministry will work in this
direction.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said promoting the upgrading of the third naphtha
cracker of the CPC in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan will be
more economically efficient in terms creating jobs, revenue and
prosperity than relocating the CPC.
