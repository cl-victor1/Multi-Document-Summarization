The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced Tuesday a decision to
impose a 43.46 percent temporary anti-dumping duty on shoes and
boots imported from China, with only one exception for a single
shoe factory.

<P>
The measure will begin March 16 and will remain in effect for up
to four months, with future adjustments depending on further
investigations, the MOF said in a news release.

<P>
The MOF said the initial investigation conducted by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs since last year has found evidence indicating
damage to Taiwan's shoe industry caused by the dumping of Chinese
shoes on the domestic market.

<P>
It said that except for one shoe factory in Guangdong Province,
all Chinese shoe manufacturers and exporters selling to Taiwan
have been found dumping their products.
