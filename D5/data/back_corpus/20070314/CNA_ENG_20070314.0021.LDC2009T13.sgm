Taipei,  March 14 (CNA) 03/14/07  17:36:36 (By Deborah Kuo)

The Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) will have no
choice but to take out loans to the tune of NT$20 billion (US$610
million) from banks this year to keep the national health
insurance  program  operational,  the bureau chief said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Health, Environment and
Social Welfare Committee, BNHI President Chu Tze-min said the
national health insurance program is expected to face a shortfall
of about NT$2 billion per month, which will cause a shortfall of
at least NT$24 billion for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
Chu said the shortfall will temporarily be solved by borrowing,
but in the long run, the spiraling debts will have to be paid
with money generated from the collection of higher levels of
health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the legislative committee session, Department of
Health Minister Hou Sheng-mao was tightlipped about whether and
when health insurance premiums will be hiked.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lai Hsin-yuan asked
Hou and Chu if the BNHI plans to hike the premiums after the
legislative election in December this year.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that since running the national health insurance program
in the red, the BNHI has shifted its financial burden onto
hospitals and clinics, which have in turn reduced the quality of
their medical services in order to keep their heads above water.
</P>
<P>
Discounting Lai's words, however, Chu said that despite financial
difficulties, the BNHI has managed to increase the budget
reserved for health insurance payments to hospitals and clinics
by an average of 5 percent per year, leaving no room for health
institutions to compromise their services.
