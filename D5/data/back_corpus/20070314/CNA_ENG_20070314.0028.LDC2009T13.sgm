Veterans Affairs Commission Chairman Hu Cheng-pu said Wednesday
that if the Executive Yuan asks for the removal of statutes of
the late President Chiang Kai-shek from veteran homes, he will
"reason" with the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks at a legislative committee when Legislator
Tang Huo-shen of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party asked if
there are any statutes of the late president in veteran homes and
what he would do if the Executive Yuan asks for their removal.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that currently there are 18 veteran homes, and that the
statutes are present in at least 14 of them.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the veteran homes are not military barracks
and that the inhabitants followed the late president to Taiwan in
their youths in 1949 after Chiang lost China in a civil war.
</P>
<P>
The veterans, now in their sunset years, have developed a strong
sentiments regarding the late Chiang and such attachments cannot
be severed easily.
</P>
<P>
"The existence of the statutes of the late president  is
significant to them" Hu said, adding that they help stabilize the
feelings of the veterans.
</P>
<P>
He said that his duty is to care for the veterans and galvanize
their support to the government. If the government removes the
statutes, the veterans will turn against the government, he aid.
</P>
<P>
Hu's remarks followed the recent removal of all statutes of the
late president from military barracks, and a series of removals
from other government agencies to shed the last vestige of the
authoritarian rule associated with the late president. The latest
removal, at the Kaohsiung Cultural Center, was conducted
accompanied by vehement protests from opposition Kuomintang
lawmakers and councilors.
