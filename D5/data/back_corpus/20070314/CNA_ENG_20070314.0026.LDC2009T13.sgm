Taiwan's aromatherapy industry has extended its market to the
medical treatment community as it has received wider recognition
from medical professionals, a local oil therapist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chuo Chih-yu, an essential oil therapist certificated by the
noted Australian essential oil brand Roonka, founded E.O. Park
more than 10 years ago.

<P>
With experience in academia, the clinical field and industry,
Chuo said that her company's 2006 revenue increased 10 percent
from 2005 and that 2007 will be a crucial year for aromatherapy
development because of wider acceptance from the medical
community.
</P>
<P>
Chuo said Australia and Europe have provided aromatherapy lessons
for the medical community for 20 years, adding that Taiwan's
medical arena started accepting the medical effectiveness of
aromatherapy after American journals published reports about the
therapy's supplementary effects in medical treatment in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chuo pointed out that the National Taipei College of Nursing
began to offer aromatherapy lessons for students four years ago
and that Liu Po-er, chairwoman of Hungkuang University 's
Department of Nursing, is considering including aromatherapy in
the school's curriculum.
