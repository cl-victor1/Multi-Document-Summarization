Four major convenience store chains -- FamilyMart, Nikomart, OK,
and Hi-Life -- signed a covenant Wednesday, promising that their
4,500 stores throughout Taiwan will strictly abide by the Tobacco
Hazards Prevention Act and not sell cigarettes to youngsters
under the age of 18.

<P>
The four chain store groups, represented by their top executives,
inked the covenant, with Hsiao Mei-ling, head of the Bureau of
Health Promotion under the Department of Health, and Cheng Jen-
hung, chairman of the Consumers Foundation, acting as witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, store cashiers should turn down children who
purchase cigarettes on behalf of adults. They must also ask those
who seem to be under 18 to produce an ID before selling
cigarettes to them.

<P>
Although another major convenience store chain, 7-Eleven, did not
sign the covenant, its top executive indicated that 7-Eleven's
4,000 outlets throughout Taiwan have already been observing the
practice.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act bans the sale of
cigarettes to anyone under 18. Those who violate the law are
subject to a fine of up to NT$15,000.
</P>
<P>
Results of a survey conducted by the Consumers' Foundation late
last year showed that 70.4 percent of convenience stores sold
cigarettes to minors -- FamilyMart had a 90 percent violation
rate, OK and Nikomart 70 percent, 7-Eleven 67.7 percent and Hi-
Life 60 percent.
