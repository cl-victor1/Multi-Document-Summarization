The Executive Yuan has no "proposed list" of which government
agencies will be relocated from the capital of Taipei to southern
Taiwan, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheng made the remarks amid reports that the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has
suggested that more government agencies be relocated southwards
to help the balanced development of southern and northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD suggested that in addition to the Council of Agriculture
and the Fisheries Administration, several other agencies, such as
the Tourism  Bureau under  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and
Communications, the Bureau of Mines under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the Council of Labor Affairs and the Council
for Hakka Affairs, are also suitable for relocation southward.
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang has recently said that if government
agencies have no geographic considerations and their businesses
are closely related to central or southern Taiwan, then they
should plan for a relocation, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng noted that the premier has only announced the relocation of
the Fisheries Administration and said there is no proposed list
of relocations of other agencies.
</P>
<P>
"Every individual case has to undergo careful assessment and
overall consideration," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the relocation of government agencies
southward is an "established policy" of the Executive Yuan.
