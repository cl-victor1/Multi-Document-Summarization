Taipei,  March 13 (CNA) 03/14/07  10:24:54 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and investigators searched famous 3C manufacturer
BenQ Corporation's  Taipei and Taoyuan headquarters Tuesday as
part of a probe into suspected insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of BenQ's shares had been sold off last March
before the company released its financial report for the last
quarter of 2005, which unveiled a huge deficit and was followed
by a slump of the company's share prices, according to Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the FSC referred its findings to the Taoyuan District
Prosecutor's Office in December.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors  are  interviewing  three  incumbent  or former high-
ranking financial and accounting officials of the company.
</P>
<P>
Neither the FSC nor the prosecution gave further details. BenQ
said in a press release that it will fully cooperate with the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
BenQ in October 2005 acquired the mobile devices division of
Germany's Siemens and set up BenQ Mobile to produce mobile phones
branded BenQ-Siemens.
</P>
<P>
But last September, the German division of the new company filed
for bankruptcy when its parent company announced that it was
ceasing funding of the loss-making sector. About 2,000 employees
lost their jobs.
