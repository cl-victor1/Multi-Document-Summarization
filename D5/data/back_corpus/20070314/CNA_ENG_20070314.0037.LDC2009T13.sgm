<P>
Atomic Energy Council (AEC) Chairman Ouyang Min-shen reacted in a
low-key manner when a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmaker suggested that the AEC develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang was responding to suggestion by DPP Legislator  Ho Shui-
sheng that Taiwan develop nuclear weapons so that China will not
threaten the island.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang noted that Taiwan is a country that champions peace, and
that it uses nuclear energy to simply serve economic ends.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan does not wish to face the fate of Pyongyang and endure
trade sanctions or other boycott measures, Ouyang said, after
all, Taiwan is an export-oriented country that relies on imports
for 98 percent of the energy needs. Therefore, it is necessary
that we maintain good relations with the world's other nations.
