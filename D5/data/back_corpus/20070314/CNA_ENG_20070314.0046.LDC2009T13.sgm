Beginning Wednesday midnight, passengers departing the country no
longer need to have their flight boarding passes stamped, the
National Immigration Agency (NIA) said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, immigration officers at the country's international
airports put a stamp on departing passengers' boarding pass as a
part of passenger identification procedures, but the NIA now
considers this action a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
The NIA said that if each stamp took two seconds, the total time
saved by the new measure, applied to an estimated 20,000
passengers each day, would be 11 hours.
</P>
<P>
The NIA said the change had been urged by airlines and will
greatly promote efficiency and improve the country's image.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the old practice was uncommon among world's
airports and actually contributed little to security, adding that
the new  policy  will shift  more  responsibility  for  passenger
identification to the airlines.
