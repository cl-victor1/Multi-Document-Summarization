Eric Yu, senior vice president and chief financial officer of
BenQ Corp., was detained after an overnight judicial
interrogation of high-ranking BenQ executives over suspected
insider trading involving the leading mobile phone maker of
Taiwan, the deputy chief prosecutor of the Taoyuan District
Prosecutor's Office said Wednesday.

Chang Chih-feng also indicated that former BenQ chief financial
executive Alex Liu was released on NT$5 million (US$151,300)
bail, noting that their investigation into the case will focus
over the next few days on the timing of the company's "irregular"
share sales, as well as how it decided to "dump" some shares.
</P>
<P>
The Taoyuan prosecutor's office recently kicked off a probe into
suspected inside trading involving BenQ after it was informed by
the Financial Supervisory Commission in December that large
amounts of BenQ's shares were sold off last March before the
company released its financial report for the last quarter of
2005, which included a huge deficit and a slump in the company's
share prices.

<P>
Prosecutors and police officers launched searches Tuesday of
BenQ's Taipei and Taoyuan headquarters and then questioned Yu,
Liu, and other BenQ accounting and manpower officials.

In October 2005, BenQ acquired the mobile devices division of
Germany's Siemens and set up BenQ Mobile to produce mobile phones
under the brand name BenQ- Siemens. However, the German division
of the new company filed for bankruptcy last September when its
parent company announced  it was ceasing funding of the money-
losing division. About 2,000 employees lost their jobs.
