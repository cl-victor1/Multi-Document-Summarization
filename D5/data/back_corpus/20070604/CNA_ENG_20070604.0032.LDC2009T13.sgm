Computex Taipei 2007, the largest computer trade show in Asia and
the second- largest in the world, will open Tuesday for a five-
day run with more than more than 1,300 domestic and international
exhibitors showing off their latest products, organizers said
Monday in a press conference.

The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , one of
two main organizers, estimated that over 130,000 visitors and
buyers will attend the annual exhibition, whose 2,926 booths will
occupy four Taipei World Trade Center halls and will run from
June 5 - 9.

The exhibition is aimed at providing buyers with their ideal
source for the best products. It is ranked alongside CeBIT
Germany as the world's top two information and communication
technology (ICT) events.

The primarily professional business-to-business (B2B) exhibition
is targeting on-site orders and sales that organizers hope will
exceed US$14.5 billion, said TAITRA Executive Vice President
Walter Yeh, adding that the show will highlight Taiwan's position
as "the world's leading ICT procurement platform."

"It was not easy to achieve the 2 percent growth in the number of
exhibitors for this year's event,  " said Li Chang,  Deputy
Secretary-General of the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), who
also described the show as "the Golden Week" for Taiwan's
information technology (IT) industry.

The  year  opened  a new  era for global  4C (computers,
communications, consumer electronics and digital content)
products in the IT industry, as all four major categories have
been upgrading, according to a COMPUTEX TAIPEI 2007 press
release.

<P>
The show is reserved exclusively for international buyers, Yeh
said, adding that it will only be open to the general public on
the last day.
