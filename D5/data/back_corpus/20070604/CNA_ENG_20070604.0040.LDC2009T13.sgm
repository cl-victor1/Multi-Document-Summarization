TAIWAN WILLING TO RE-NEGOTIATE TORCH RELAY ROUTE: MAC HEAD
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, June 4 (CNA) 06/04/07  23:32:30 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is willing to re-negotiate the Olympic torch relay route,
the nation's top China policy charter said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Ming-tong, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made
the remarks when he was interviewed by the Hong Kong China News
Agency, set up in 1956 in Hong Kong to offer news services to
newspapers in Chinese in Hong Kong, Macau and foreign countries,
as well as newspaper supplements.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted Chen as saying that after Taipei rejected the
torch relay route, Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of
Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad,
said there is still a year before the start of the relay and both
sides could talk about the matter.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan is willing to re-negotiate and is now waiting
for Beijing to float a new proposal and convey sincerity in
wishing to restart the talks.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that when both sides of the Taiwan Strait discussed the
torch relay route early this year, they signed meeting minutes.
The Taiwan delegate brought back the planned route for study and
gave written agreement to the plan in March, although the plan at
the time did not include Macau.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Macau is not a member of the International Olympic
committee (IOC) and that the route plan turned Taipei into a
"domestic leg" of the relay.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's reference of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee as
"Taipei, China" is also unacceptable, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that "taking part in IOC-sponsored activities is
our right as a member of the IOC and we'll surely attend the 2008
Games."
</P>
<P>
He said that when Beijing bid for the 2008 Olympics, Taipei also
cast a "yes" vote, but the torch relay route shows that Taiwan's
goodwill gesture has not received a reciprocal response from
China.
</P>
<P>
According to China's plan when it announced the torch relay route
in April 26, the Olympic torch will travel from Vietnam's Ho Chi
Minh City to Taipei and then continue on to Hong Kong, Macau and
several other Chinese cities before arriving in the host city,
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan rejected the route planning at that time, saying that the
route is unacceptable as it deliberately downgrade Taiwan's
sovereign status.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan wants the torch to come to Taipei via a third country and
travel on to another country.
