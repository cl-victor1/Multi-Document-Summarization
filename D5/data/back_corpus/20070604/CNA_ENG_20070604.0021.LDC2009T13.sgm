PROBES INTO DPP OFFICIALS' `SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FUND' CONTINUING:
PANEL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  June 4 (CNA) 06/04/07  19:39:10 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Probes into alleged misuse of discretionary "special allowance
funds" by several prominent figures in the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) are continuing and are being conducted in
an impartial way, a special investigation panel under the Supreme
Prosecutors Office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yun-nan, director of the panel, said the investigations into
DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, Vice President Annette
Lu, former Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and
Tan Sun Chen, former secretary-general to President Chen Shui-
bian, have not stalled.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a news conference after Minister of
Justice Shih Mao- lin instructed the Supreme Prosecutors Office
to explain the progress of the probes that day. Fielding
questions at a legislative committee May 31, Shih was asked by
legislators why the probes seem to be progressing slowly.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that other high-profile probes into the alleged misuse
of the "special affairs fund" involving President Chen Shui-bian
and first lady Wu Shu- jen, as well as the "special allowance
fund" involving main opposition Kuomintang presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou, took several months before the
prosecutors formally pressed charges.
</P>
<P>
"An individual  case takes several months,  let alone the
investigations into several cases simultaneously, " Chen said,
adding that some of the allegedly misused funds were claimed over
a period of seven or eight years, which will take even more time
to investigate.
</P>
<P>
"The special investigation panel has not been dragging its feet,"
Chen said, adding that "there are no political considerations in
the probes."
</P>
<P>
He said the panel has followed the principle of caution during
the investigations and has not explained the progress at any
time, which he said could be the reason leading to the impression
of a slow pace.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that since the panel assigned the cases April 14 to a
team of three prosecutors including Hou Kuan-jen, the team has
been working assiduously.
</P>
<P>
Hou is the key figure behind the March 13 indictment of Ma, a
former Taipei mayor, over his alleged misuse of the "special
allowance fund" during his mayoral term between 1998 and 2006.
The indictment forced Ma to resign as KMT chairman, although he
has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that since the cases were assigned, they have asked
the Ministry of Audit to provide original invoices or receipts
for verification and have instructed financial institutions as
well as relevant companies to provide transaction records.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors have to pore over all relevant documents, which
he pointed out is both time-consuming and laborious.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said the prosecutors have so far summoned various
accountants and cashiers to testify 52 times in an attempt to
shed light on the use of the previously little-understood
"special allowance fund," although he admitted that none of the
targeted DPP officials had yet been summoned by the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
All executives  holding public office are given a special
allowance fund every month. Although the spending of the money is
left up to the administrative chief's discretion, half of the
fund can be reimbursed without any proof of spending, while use
of the other half must be substantiated with invoices or
receipts.
