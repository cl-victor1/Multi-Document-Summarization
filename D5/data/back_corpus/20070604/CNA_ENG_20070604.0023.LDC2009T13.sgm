Computex Taipei 2007 will open Tuesday at the World Trade Center,
with some 130,000 people expected to visit the world's second-
largest computer show, including 30,000 potential buyers,
according to the organizer, the semi-official Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA).

TAITRA officials estimated Monday that the value of orders placed
during the June 5-9 fair is expected to surpass US$15 billion.

A total of 2,926 stalls have been set up at the Computex venues,
which cover three exhibition halls of the World Trade Center and
the Taipei International Convention Hall, with most of Taiwan's
leading businesses in the sector, including Acer Inc., AsusTek
Computer Inc. and the Foxconn Technology Group, having a presence
at the show.

TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Yeh Ming-shuei said that as the
annual Computex is defined as a professional trade fair, it won't
be open to the general public until the last day of the
exhibition. He noted that buyers usually place their orders
during the fair for the up-to-date products showcased in CeBIT,
the world's largest computer exposition held every spring in
Hanover, Germany.

Under the trend, trading deals valued at US$12.7 billion in total
were forged during the 2006 Computex, Yeh said, assessing that
the value of orders will grow significantly this year.
