The public was urged Monday not to use the newly built Yuchang
highway in the eastern county of Hualien as the highway is not
yet officially open for public use, according to officials from
the Directorate General of Highways.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after the officials found that barricades
blocking either end of the highway had been removed and that
people were using the road.
</P>
<P>
Although safety inspections of the highway have been completed,
the officials said, the public should not use it, in order, they
claimed "to prevent accidents."
</P>
<P>
However, local police said that as no stop signs have been set up
at the entrances to the highway, they cannot impose penalties on
anyone choosing to use the road.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible for constructing the highway should set up
warning signs, or will be held responsible for any accidents that
occur on the highway, the police officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The 16.26-km highway links Yuli township in Hualien County and
Changbin township in the neighboring county of Taitung. The
highway is expected to reduce the drive time between the two
places from 90 minutes to 20-30 minutes.
