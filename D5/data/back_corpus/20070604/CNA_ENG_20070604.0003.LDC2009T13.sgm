A new industrial park for precision instrument makers is expected
to be developed in Chiayi County beginning this year to create
another high-technology manufacturing arm in southern Taiwan,
Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As of the start of this month, 24 companies have expressed an
interest in investing in the new industrial park, and these
companies are scheduled to meet with Chiayi County officials June
7 to sign letters of intent on their planned investment, Chen
said.

<P>
A potential industrial park covering an area of 439 hectares in
Tapumei,  Talin township near the Chungshan Freeway's  Meishan
Interchange was first zoned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
in 2000 as the future site of a high-technology industrial park.
</P>
<P>
The development project, however, failed to get off the ground
until last year, when the Chiayi County government decided to
alter its plans and make the area into a center for biotechnology
manufacturing and precision instrument production, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 86 hectares of land at the site was rezoned as a
future biotech manufacturing center, with land preparation work
then getting underway in June 2006, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that some 150 hectares of land at the site was recently
rezoned as the base to house precision instrument manufacturing
companies.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen and executives of
the Republic of China Instrumental Machinery Association are
expected to travel to Talin June 7 to witness the signing of
letters of intent, Chen said.
