Taipei,  June 4 (CNA) 06/04/07  18:42:13 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has asked all levels of
investigation authorities to wipe out the theft of water gates
that has had a serious impact on farmland irrigation and flood
prevention, an MOJ official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said each local district prosecutors office set up
a team in February 2005 to clamp down on this type of crime
involving public property including water gate theft, but the MOJ
has made major efforts to curb such thefts more effectively.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ has asked the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office to supervise
investigations by local district prosecutors offices on water
gate thefts and work out plans and strategies for effective
prevention and investigation, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Local district prosecutors offices will need to help local police
departments to establish  teams  to reinforce  contacts  with
investigation authorities, and will need to appoint a prosecutor
to be in charge of water gate theft investigation cases, if
necessary, he went on.
</P>
<P>
All investigations need thorough follow-ups in order to find out
if the thefts are being committed by criminal gangs, as stealing
huge public facilities like water gates is unlikely to be easily
done by individuals, the spokesman said, adding that
investigations also need to shed light on other irregularities
related to the theft of the high-value steel gates.
</P>
<P>
Local district prosecutors offices should also enhance monitoring
of people with criminal records and should assist local police
departments to find out where the stolen gates are being sold,
the spokesman said.
