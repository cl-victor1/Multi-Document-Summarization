FORMER PREMIER PLANNING TO ORGANIZE NEW 'MIDDLE WAY' GROUP

Taipei,  June  4 (CNA) 06/04/07  14:49:49 (By Deborah Kuo)

Former Premier Tang Fei is planning to organize a new "middle
way" political group representing middle-class individuals and
intellectuals who are not supporters of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) or any of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who was the first premier of the DPP administration after
Chen Shui-bian became the first DPP president in 2000, is
organizing the new "Taiwan Future Prospects Society" and calling
for members of the middle class and intellectuals who have lost
hope in the current state of Taiwan politics to "grasp their
future in their own hands."
</P>
<P>
Wang Hsin-nan, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said he
offers his blessing to Tang over the initiative but added that he
is afraid that Tang's new group may not survive given the tense
situation in Taiwan's current political climate.
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on Tang's plan, DPP Legislator Tsai Chi-chang
said Tang's ambition to solve the long-term deadlock between the
"pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, and the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and its ally, the People First Party, is applaudable.
However, he added that if Tang is unable to tackle the issue of
national identity, his "middle way" advocacy will lead his
followers nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hsu Shao-ping, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus,
also offered her blessing to Tang, saying that Tang's call for
"rational middle voters" to step forward to cast their votes in
the 2008 presidential  election is more well- intentioned  than
the mentality harbored by the group calling for people not to go
to the polls at all.
</P>
<P>
Chou Shou-hsun, a deputy convener of the KMT legislative caucus,
said that Tang's initiative is welcome, particularly at a time
when all the country's citizens are disillusioned with the
sitting DPP administration.
