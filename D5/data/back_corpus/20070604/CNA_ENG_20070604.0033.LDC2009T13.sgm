Citizen participation has been long overlooked but will be an
important factor in our living in the new millennium as well as
an integral part of urban design and community infrastructure
establishment, a German architect said Monday in an international
workshop.
</P>
<P>
Three groups of workshop participants presented their ideas and
plans on the themes of rivers, garden city and community public
spaces in the final presentation of a five-day workshop titled
"Living and Housing in the 3rd Millennium: Ideas and Strategies
for Better Living in Taipei" that was guided by German architect
Klaus Luig.
</P>
<P>
"All human beings are responsible for our future with the
objective of enhancing quality of life. While nature and
sustainable growth know no borders, it's essential to exchange
ideas, " Luig said, adding that modern day urban development
often ignores the citizens.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, organized by the German Cultural Center in Taipei,
brought together participants from different generations,
nationalities and professional backgrounds to work on ideas for
Taipei's future during five days of discussions and
brainstorming.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwanese architecture and urban design are dominated by elitism
and ignore civic participation, " said Janice Chen, who was in a
group that developed a plan to better make use of the riverside
park on the Hsintien river.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to let the real users -- the citizens -- participate
in the development, management and design of their communities
and environments, " she added.
</P>
<P>
The other groups worked out plans to redevelop New Garden City,
an old community in suburban Taipei, and the sustainable
utilization and management of community public spaces in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the ideas these participants came up with are actually
workable and will be a very good source and reference for the
government, while some of them are pretty idealistic, " Luig
commented after the presentation.
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget, however, the building of a wall starts with the
first brick. This is a good start, " he said.
