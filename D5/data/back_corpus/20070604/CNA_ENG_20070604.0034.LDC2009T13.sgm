Kaohsiung,  June 4 (CNA) 06/04/07  22:02:27 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The flagfall taxi fare in the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung
will rise from NT$70 to NT$85 (US$2.57) from July 1, the
Transportation Bureau under the Kaohsiung city government
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kuo-tsai, head of the Transportation Bureau, said the city
government agreed to the taxi industry's proposal for a price
hike after most respondents polled in a survey endorsed the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the move will be formally sanctioned during a
city government meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that the taxi fare in Kaohsiung has not been
adjusted for the past six years and that an increase is needed to
reflect rising fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
He added that the rate following the NT$85 basic fare for the
first one- and-a-half kilometers will remain unchanged at NT$5
per 250 meters.
