Taipei,  June  4 (CNA) 06/04/07  19:35:56 (By Deborah Kuo)

The 2008 presidential candidate of the opposition Kuomintang said
Monday that if he is elected as the next president of the
Republic of China, he will talk seriously with Beijing about
Taiwan's space and status in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop with representatives of Taiwanese business
associations in China,  Ma Ying-jeou said Taiwan's diplomatic
resources should not be wasted "for nothing" any longer and that
if elected, he would strive to negotiate with the Beijing
leadership to reach an agreement on Taiwan's participation in
more global organizations.
</P>
<P>
That agreement, Ma said, would not be a zero-sum consensus but a
pragmatic problem-solver.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his campaign team has hammered out bilateral and
multilateral solutions on the issue. For example, he noted,
Taiwan should first try to gain accession into the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he went on, the first thing he would like to talk with
Beijing is about the cross-Taiwan Strait security issue, adding
that he would seek to negotiate with Beijing officials based on
the so-called  "92 consensus"  in order to reach an agreement on
cross-strait security.
</P>
<P>
That agreement, he said, would mainly feature a mutual trust
military mechanism aimed at ending cross-strait hostility in the
shortest possible period.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that if he is elected, he will definitely improve
business and trade ties across the strait, normalize business and
trade relations, negotiate over the opening of direct air links
and allow Taiwan's banking institutions to operate in China.
</P>
<P>
He said he will also seek agreements with China on investment
guarantees, double-taxation  exemption and related measures to
facilitate the establishment of a cross-strait common market.
</P>
<P>
He expressed  hope that Taiwan will increase cultural and
educational exchanges with China, including mutual recognition of
academic degrees conferred by schools on both sides and allowing
Taiwan institutes to recruit students from China.
</P>
<P>
Ma accused the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP)
administration of failing to do anything constructive for the
Taiwan people over the past seven years, saying that the DPP is
simply an electioneering machine that never delivers its campaign
promises.
