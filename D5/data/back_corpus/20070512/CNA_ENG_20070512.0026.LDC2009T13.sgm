SU'S RESIGNATION NOT TO AFFECT DPP'S PRESIDENTIAL BID: VP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  19:07:45 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday that she believes Su
Tseng-chang's stepping down from the premiership won't shake the
ruling Democratic Progressive  Party's  (DPP) solidarity, nor
harm the party's presidential bid next year.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks in response to media inquires on the
premier's resignation while in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan,
to attend a musical concert honoring 10 mothers on the eve of
Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
Lu said she was unaware of the matter until Su announced earlier
in the day that he had tendered resignation to President Chen
Shui-bian and that Chen has accepted it. She also said that she
did not know the reason for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Su might have believed that he had to step down to shoulder
responsibility for the failure to have the budget for the
Executive Yuan's operations in 2007 passed at the Legislative
Yuan, Lu conjectured.
</P>
<P>
Others have suggested that Su's resignation resulted from his
failure to win the DPP's presidential candidacy in the primary
May 6.
</P>
<P>
Asked about a report speculating former premier Chang Chun-hsiung
might take up the post again, Lu said he would be a good choice,
and added that she hopes the person who assumes the premier's
office make national affairs the top priority.
