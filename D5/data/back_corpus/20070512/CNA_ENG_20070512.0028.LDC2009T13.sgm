TAIPEI CITY GOV'T DEFIANT OVER NAME CHANGE ISSUE

Taipei,  May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  19:47:20 (By Flor Wang)

The Taipei city government will not alter the name of bus stops
and mass rapid train (MRT) system stations in areas adjacent to
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall regardless of a name change for
the monument by the central government, Taipei Mayor Hau Long-bin
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Despite an Executive Yuan order May 9 changing the name of CKS
Memorial Hall to "Taiwan Democracy Hall, " the Taipei city
government will not follow suit by changing the name of bus stops
and MRT stations in the hall's perimeter to save public funds and
avoid inconveniencing the public, Hau said.
</P>
<P>
Simply changing the names of bus stops and MRT stations --
something which Hau said lacks substantial meaning -- will cost
some NT$8 million.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Hau said, the Taipei city government has designated
the hall as a historical relic so as to conserve it, contrary to
the central government's plan to tear down its walls and rename
it in line  with the ruling  Democratic Progressive  Party's
"name rectification" drive. Thus any actions taken to change the
hall's current shape or appearance would constitute a violation
of the relevant law, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education, which promulgated May 10 a
set of regulations to govern the would-be Taiwan Democracy Hall's
operations, is set to unveil a plaque on the building and
announce its official inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The controversial name change campaign was rekindled in Jan. this
year by ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman  Yu
Shyi-kun, with President Chen Shui-bian echoing Yu's efforts to
push for a name change of the CKS Memorial Hall and for the
removal of Chiang's name and statutes from military barracks and
public establishments across the country.
