Taipei,  May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  18:05:11 (By Flor Wang)

<P>
The government is considering designating May 15 as the nation's
"Children's Day" to raise public awareness of kids' personal
safety in both public and private places, Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) Lee Yi-yang said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, his ministry recently called a meeting with the
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs,  the Department  of Health and the National
Communications Communication to discuss the issue amid a growing
number of accidents involving children in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 kindergarten children were burned to death May 15,
1992, in Taipei inside a mini bus, on their way to a picnic after
the vehicle burst into flames, sending a great shock throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Citing MOI statistics,  Lee said, 85 percent of incidents
involving children were caused by human error, adding that
children's safety will be better protected if adequate heed is
paid to security for youngsters in public or private venues.
</P>
<P>
To serve that end, relevant measures and reporting mechanisms,
which might provide guidelines to future action, were studied
during the inter-agency meeting to help ensure that Taiwanese
children grow up in a safe and secure environment.
