TAIWAN'S WHO BID MEANS NO CHANGES IN NATIONAL TITLE: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geneva,  May 11 (CNA) 05/12/07  13:32:35 (By Neil Lu and Y.F.
Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Friday that Taiwan's
application to join the World Health Organization (WHO) under the
name of "Taiwan" does not mean any changes in its national title
and thus has not violated his "four noes" commitments.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during a satellite video conference with
international media in Geneva, an event held ahead of the World
Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making arm -- to
promote the country's bid to become a full member of the WHO
under the name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Showing a letter addressed to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan
through which the application was filed, Chen pointed out that
the letter was sent in the name of the president of "Republic of
China" -- the country's official name.
</P>
<P>
However, as the country can neither change its official title nor
use the name "Republic of China" to apply to join international
organizations, it has decided to use the name "Taiwan," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the decision is correct because "Taiwan" is
the "most beautiful, suitable and satisfactory" name for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed the move does not involve nor violate his "four
noes" commitments to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to pledges made in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural
addresses that if China has no intention of using force against
Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan independence, not change the
official name of the country, not include the "state-to-state"
concept on cross-strait relations in the Constitution, and not
promote a referendum to change the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Although in favor of Taiwan's participation as an observer in the
WHA, the United States has adopted a position of not supporting
Taiwan's pursuit for membership in international organizations
where statehood is required and has repeatedly stressed the
importance it attaches to the "four noes" pledges.
</P>
<P>
The president said he understands the U.S. stand on the issue but
he also urged the United States to listen to the voices of
Taiwan's 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan's bid for observer status at the WHA has
remained unsuccessful for the past 10 years, Chen said the
country will continue to work on the goal of being included in
the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he has written Chan three times to insist that the WHO
deal with Taiwan's application according to due process, although
that request was unilaterally turned down by the WHO Secretariat
on each occasion on the grounds that Taiwan is not a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
While 12 of Taiwan's diplomatic allies have also written to Chan
on behalf of Taiwan, they are expected to once again raise the
issue during this year's WHA, slated to open May 14.
