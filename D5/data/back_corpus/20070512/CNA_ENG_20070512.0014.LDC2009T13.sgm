PREMIER ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION (update-1)
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 12 (CNA) 05/12/07  14:22:42 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Saturday that he is stepping
down from his post.
</P>
<P>
Su, who assumed the premiership in January 2006, made the
announcement at a news conference after his resignation was
approved by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Su said that after the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) primary vote last Sunday, he has continued to push
administrative issues.
</P>
<P>
But he said that in view of the fact that the president "will
need a new lineup to deal with a changed situation during the
last year of his tenure, " he is willing to step aside to
accommodate the new situation.
</P>
<P>
"Although I am leaving the post of premiership, my heart will be
always with Taiwan," Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su, who suffered a surprising defeat in the DPP primary vote May
6, said he will engage in soul-searching, return to the
grassroots, and listen to voices from all quarters at home and
abroad in the hope of finding the means to do more for the
people, the nation, the party and the party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
Although the first phase -- DPP member vote -- of the DPP primary
is far from perfect, Su said that he decided to announce his
withdrawal from the primary upon learning the results of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Former Premier Frank Hsieh emerged as the winner in the primary
vote after garnering 44.6 percent of the vote, compared with Su's
33.4 percent. Hsieh is set to be nominated by the DPP to
represent the party in the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The other contenders in the primary -- Vice President Annette Lu,
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- also displayed party solidarity after
the primary vote, which Su said should put the party's supporters
at ease.
</P>
<P>
Su, who reportedly offered to resign several times during his
tenure of just over one year and three months, was the fifth
premier since Chen was first elected president in 2000, ending
more than five decades of Kuomintang rule.
