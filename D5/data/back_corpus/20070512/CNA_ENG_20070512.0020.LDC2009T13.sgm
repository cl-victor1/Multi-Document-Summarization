Main opposition Kuomintang candidate Chang Tung-jung declared
Saturday that he has won the mayoral by-election of the port
city.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the declaration before the vote counting had ended
after he garnered more than 56,000 votes, far ahead of his
closest rival, Liu Wen-hsiung of the People First Party, who won
more than 33,000 votes, and Shih Shih-ming of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, who won more than 26,000 votes.
Another two contenders were far behind.

<P>
The by-election was made necessary after the port city's mayor
Hsu Tsai-li died earlier this year from diabetes-related
complications.
