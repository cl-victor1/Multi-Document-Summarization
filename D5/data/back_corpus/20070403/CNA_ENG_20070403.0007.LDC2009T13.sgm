FORMER TAIPEI MAYOR'S CORRUPTION TRIAL OPENS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  April 3 (CNA) 04/03/07  12:38:37 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
Former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said he had not intended to
embezzle public funds and expressed the hope that justice will
vindicate him as the first court hearing on his corruption trial
opened at the Taipei District Court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted Feb. 13 for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million
(US$338,500) from a special allowance fund designated for his
discretionary use while serving as Taipei mayor from 1998 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
Ma, as well as Yu Wen, a secretary of the Taipei City Government,
appeared at the court as defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
Outside the court, there were clashes between Ma's supporters and
opponents. Scores of Ma's supporters shouted slogans such as
"justice returns innocence to Ma" and "fair trial, " while Peter
Wang, convener of the pro-independence 908 Taiwan Republic
Campaign, questioned the different treatment given to different
individuals under the judicial system, calling Ma names for
insisting on running in next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
When asked by presiding judge Tsai Shou-shun how they plead, Ma
responded by saying: "I have done nothing wrong, " while Yu
pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he had considered that the half of the "special
allowance fund" that went directly into his bank accounts and for
which only receipts were required for reimbursement purposes were
not public funds, but instead of the nature of subsidies for
local government heads as is customary for more than 6,000
ranking officials around the country.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that he had never personally handled the reimbursement
process of the special allowance fund and that he had not
intended or acted to do things illegally.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen said in the indictment that Ma received
NT$10.23 million in special allowances during his first term from
December 1998 to December 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, expenditure records from Ma's bank accounts show that he
spent only NT$3.49 million of that amount and failed to return
the unspent portion -- NT$6.74 million -- to the national
coffers, Hou continued.
</P>
<P>
From January 2004 through July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the
NT$5.06 million fund and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in
his account, according to Hou.
</P>
<P>
Hou contended that the unspent money during Ma's two terms,
totaling NT$11.7 million, should be considered as "gains from
embezzlement."
