The soon-to-be signed free trade agreement (FTA) between the
United States and South Korea will have an estimated US$2 billion
impact on Taiwan, which is equivalent to about 5 percent of
Taiwan's total exports, a spokesman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and South Korea reached an agreement on the free trade
pact Monday, and U.S. President Bush has sent the agreement to
the U.S. Congress for approval. Once signed, the U.S.-Korea FTA
is expected to increase the value of trade between the two
countries by tens of billions of dollars for both sides and help
invigorate South Korea's economy.
</P>
<P>
The CEPD spokesman said the estimated US$2 billion impact comes
from items exported by both South Korea and Taiwan to the U.S.,
adding that the government will keep an eye on other possible
impacts such as a loss of export orders and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary estimate was research made by the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research at the request of the CEPD.
</P>
<P>
According to the research, many of South Korea's bulk quantity
exports, such as automobiles to U.S. will not directly influence
the exports of Taiwanese firms, as South Korea exports whole
vehicles, while Taiwan exports mainly auto parts.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said the
U.S.-South Korea FTA will have less influence on Taiwan's
information

<P>
technology industry, but might prompt American investors to
</P>
<P>
consider South Korea a better investment environment than Taiwan,
</P>
<P>
adding that MOEA hopes for a breakthrough in signing a free trade
</P>
<P>
agreement with the U.S. in the near future.
