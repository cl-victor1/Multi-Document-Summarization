A medical university in Taiwan has inked a cooperation deal with
a counterpart in Mongolia as part of efforts to help improve the
dental health of the Moguls, an university spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal came after officials from Chung Shan Medical University
and its College of Oral Medicine met with Bazar Amarsaikhan, Dean
of School of Dentistry under Health Sciences University of
Mongolia Monday in Taichung city, central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chung Shan Medical University said that it will send a medical
team to Mongolia this summer to provide voluntary dental services
to locals.
</P>
<P>
The university will also encourage its students to go to Mongolia
and promote hygiene awareness, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the university will offer scholarships to Mongolian
medical students and help them come to Taiwan to learn advanced
dental practices, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
With a shortage of medical professionals, poor hygiene and
outdated hospital facilities, more than 300,000 Moguls are forced
to seek medical help in neighboring countries every year, the
spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia already sends many of its doctors to Taiwan each year,
despite the absence of diplomatic ties between the two countries,
the spokesman pointed out.
