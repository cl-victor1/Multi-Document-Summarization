The number of motorbike thefts in Taipei has decreased
considerably since police began a free service to mark vehicle
identification numbers on components of motorcycles and scooters,
a spokesman for the Taipei City Police Bureau said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics, the spokesman pointed out that police in
Taipei have etched vehicle serial numbers on 215,900 motorbikes
since July last year, making it more difficult for thieves to
sell their loot.
</P>
<P>
He said that between July 2006 and February this year, 6,112
motorbikes were reported as stolen, representing a drop of 12.62
percent, compared with the corresponding period from July 2005 to
February 2006.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that police will continue to provide the free
service at a number of imprinting stations in the city.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than 11 million motorcycles
and scooters in Taiwan, with approximately 700,000 new motorbikes
sold on the domestic market each year.
</P>
<P>
An average of 200,000 motorbikes are stolen in Taiwan each year.
Most stolen bikes are disassembled, with their parts being sold
in China, the Philippines and West African countries.
