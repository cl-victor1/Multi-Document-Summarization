The arrival of a continental polar air mass has brought inclement
weather to most parts of Taiwan, and weather conditions are not
expected to improve until April 5, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) said in a forecast Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the CWB, the cold front has brought showers to many
parts of Taiwan and pushed the mercury down, with Danshui in
northern Taiwan recording a temperature of 12.5 Celsius early
Tuesday -- the lowest among all cities and townships in the
country.

<P>
CWB meteorologists said that there will be a 60 percent to 70
percent chance of showers for most parts of Taiwan over the next
two days and that mountainous areas might see heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
They forecast daytime temperatures Wednesday of around 16 degrees
Celsius in the north, 20 degrees in the eastern part of the
island, and 23 degrees in the south.

<P>
Temperatures are expected to rise from April 5, but northern
Taiwan will continue to experience showers, the meteorologists
said. By Han Nai-kuo)
