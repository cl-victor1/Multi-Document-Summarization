Premier Su Tseng-chang reiterated Tuesday that he is willing to
accept President Chen Shui-bian's mediation of a ticket for the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the 2008
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"So long as the DPP unity can be maintained, I will accept
whatever approach adopted by Chen in mediation," Su said, adding
that he is open to Chen's mediation.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan when he was asked about the result of the poll
published by the United Daily News earlier the same day. The poll
shows that former Premier Frank Hsieh's approval rating has
surged since the party's four bigwigs -- Su, Hsieh, Vice
President Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- formally
registered their bids last month.
</P>
<P>
"We have conducted our own public opinion polls, and the results
are different," Su said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "we'll attached importance to all kinds of
views and use them for reference."
</P>
<P>
The result of the public opinion poll showed that Hsieh is
leading among the four DPP contenders bidding to represent the
party in next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, Hsieh's approval rating among all eligible
voters stands at 26 percent, surpassing Su, whose rating is 23
percent, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the two widened to 10 percentage points among
voters excluding those in favor of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) or People First Party (PFP) with approval rating for Su
standing at 20 percent and rating for Hsieh standing at 30
percent. Both Lu and Yu trailed far behind Su and Hsieh in the
March 30-April 1 poll on all eligible voters or on voters
excluding KMT or PFP supporters.
</P>
<P>
Su said that if he wins the right to represent the DPP in next
year's presidential election, he is willing to invite any of the
other three aspirants to serve as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will choose someone who will "take care of
Taiwan's interests" and help form a ticket that has the best
chance of winning the election.
</P>
<P>
However, Su stopped short of saying that he would serve as a
running mate if any of the other aspirants  win the party's
nomination, only mentioning that "as a party member, I'll
definitely stump for the nominee."
</P>
<P>
He said that the most urgent task is to take care of Taiwan's
sovereignty and security and to continue to develop the economy
as well as a fairer and more just society.
</P>
<P>
Su said he envisions "making Taiwan better, warmer and more just,
" and not "jockeying for major posts at the expense of
principles."
