<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang accepted Tuesday Government Information
Office (GIO) Minister Cheng Wen-tang's offer to resign over a
controversy surrounding his disputed role regarding the sale of
shares in the state-run Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTV).
</P>
<P>
Cheng has come under attack by opposition lawmakers in recent
days after Sumio Hasegawa, a representative of Japan's Fuji TV
network, accused the GIO head early this week of attempting to
persuade him, during a Jan. 17 dinner gathering in Taipei, to
sell the TTV shares that his company holds to the Taipei-based
Liberty Time Group by citing the group's good relations with the
Democratic Progressive Party administration.
