KMT PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY KICKS OFF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   April   3  (CNA) 04/03/07  13:39:30 (By Lilian Wu)

The main opposition  Kuomintang's presidential primary formally
kicked off Tuesday,  with former chairman Ma Ying-jeou being the
first one to send someone to pick up a registration form.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who appeared at the Taipei District Court as a defendant in a
corruption trial the same day, was unable to pick up the
registration form himself. Nine KMT city councilmen, including
such mavericks as Lin Yi-hua and Wu Chih-kang, came on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
The nine councilmen arrived at the KMT headquarters at 9:09 a.m.,
an auspicious time as the number nine is considered lucky in
Chinese culture and the "Jeou" in the former Taipei mayor's name
means "nine" in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
According to the primary process promulgated by the KMT, all
aspirants can pick up forms from April 3-5 and register from May
19-22. Those who take part in the presidential primary have to
put forward a deposit of NT$7 million (US$212,000) . The
aspirants must pay NT$2 million when they pick up the forms, and
the money will not be returned even if the aspirants do not
register.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, the other possible KMT
presidential aspirant, said Monday that he will not run in the
KMT's primary for the 2008 presidential election because the
party's rules are custom-made to cater to a "certain individual"
and therefore cannot ensure a fair contest.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, made the announcement one day
after Ma said he will run in the next presidential election even
if he is convicted of corruption in the first trial.
</P>
<P>
Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of embezzling NT$11.17 million
from a special allowance fund budgeted for his discretionary use
during his term as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006.
