KMT FACES TOUGH TASK AHEAD AS LEGISLATIVE CANDIDACY REGISTRATION
ENDS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  April 3 (CNA) 04/03/07  13:22:27 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has a critical task ahead
with the closure of candidacy registration for party nomination
for the year-end legislative elections, analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As many electoral districts saw more than one aspirant register
for party nomination for the "single-member constituency"
legislative elections, analysts said KMT executives will have a
hard time choosing the party's candidates for those areas while
maintaining party harmony and unity.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yi said the party central will do
its best to choose the candidates with the best prospects through
mediation. For those districts where negotiations fail to produce
a candidate, he said, an institutionalized mechanism for
selecting a candidate will be employed.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanism can either be a series of public opinion polls or
public opinion polls plus a vote by party members," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Initial tallies show that Taipei City's third district as well as
Hsinchu City and the "plains Aborigines" community will be the
most hotly contested areas, with four contenders vying for the
KMT's nomination to represent the party. Seven other areas have
three hopefuls competing for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  five of the incumbent KMT legislators -- Chou Shou-
hsun, Chiu Yi, Joanna C. Lei, Chang Li-shan and Lin Nan-sheng --
didn't register for the party primaries.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Chou is likely to be drafted by the KMT to run in
Taipei City's Tatung-Shihlin district, which has traditionally
been a stronghold of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).
</P>
<P>
Chiu, a controversial lawmaker from the southern port city of
Kaohsiung,  didn't register  mainly because  he will soon be
incarcerated for his role in a violent protest at the Kaohsiung
District Court back in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Lei reportedly has dropped her re-election bid because she does
not want to compete against a KMT colleague in the same district
in Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
Chang, a first-term lawmaker from southern Yunlin County, didn't
register because she has yet to decide whether she wants to run
for re-election, and Lin from the southern city of Tainan said he
didn't register primarily due to his "reluctance to sabotage
party unity."
</P>
<P>
The year-end legislative elections will mark the first time that
a"single-member constituency,  two votes" electoral  system is
introduced. As the number of legislative seats will be nearly
halved from the current 225 to 113 under the new system,
competition within major parties and between parties in the
elections is expected to be intense.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Wu said the party headquarters plans to
draft Chou Shou- hsun to run in Taipei City's Tatung-Shihlin
district as he is believed to have the best chance of defeating
the ruling DPP's candidate. As five other KMT members have
registered for the party primary in the district, Wu said
mediation is needed to pave the way for Chou's entry into the
race in the district.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that the mediation can succeed so that the
process can serve as a model for other electoral districts to
emulate," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new electoral system, Wu said, it is imperative that a
single party hopeful runs for a single regional seat in each
constituency.
</P>
<P>
"We should pull out all the stops to prevent defeated contenders
in the party primaries from running on their own because a split
vote among our grass-roots supporters would result in victory for
someone else," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
As to whether any KMT primary loser is likely to quit the party
and run under the DPP banner, Wu said the possibility is very
low, if not nil.
</P>
<P>
"The DPP would only welcome those who can win in the general
elections. At the moment, only one of our legislators, Lee Sen-
zong, meets such a prerequisite, and just barely," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Besides mediating among KMT aspirants, Wu acknowledged that the
party must simultaneously give priority to consultations with its
"pan-blue" ally -- the People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
Legislative sources said mediating to produce a single "pan-blue"
candidate in certain areas will be a tall order, particularly in
Taichung  County's  Tali constituency  and  Kaohsiung  City's
Tsoying-Nantzu district.
</P>
<P>
While PFP executives  prefer to field a single "pan-blue"
candidate in disputed areas, the sources said, their counterparts
would like to resolve the disputes by holding public opinion
polls or some other mutually acceptable way.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, working out a compromise will be a tough test of both
sides' political wisdom and willpower, " said a KMT official who
preferred anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said he believes that if
the proposal to hold the next legislative elections
simultaneously with the presidential election early next year is
adopted, the possibility of "pan-blue" legislative hopefuls
running on their own without the party's endorsement will be
lower, because the general political atmosphere in such a
scenario would favor unity instead of division.
</P>
<P>
"The trend will be even more evident if former KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou is formally nominated to represent the 'pan-blue
alliance' in the next presidential election," he added.
