The Kaohsiung Blood Center has called for people to donate blood
ahead of the Lunar New Year to help deal with an expected blood
shortage during the holiday period, the center's spokesman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The center provides about 1,200 250 c.c. bags of blood to medical
institutes in Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County, Pingtung City and
Pingtung County everyday, the spokesman said, adding that the
center currently only has a four-day back-up supply of blood,
short of its minimum safety supply of seven days.
</P>
<P>
With several cold fronts forecast to hit Taiwan during the
holiday period, an increase in the number of cardiovascular
disease patients is expected, putting a strain on the blood
supply, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all four blood types --- O, A, B and AB
-- are in short supply and that blood donations are appreciated
in order to ensure a sufficient supply of blood during the
holiday period.
</P>
<P>
People who donate blood at the Kaohsiung Blood Center or at
activities held by the center at other sites from Feb. 10-16 will
receive oyster essence presented by Paolyta Co., the spokesman
said.
