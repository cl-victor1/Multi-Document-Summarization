Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA) 02/10/07  14:58:49 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
Taiwan's central bank announced Saturday it has changed its
English designation as shown on its official Web site.
</P>
<P>
The monetary authority, which was originally referred to as
"Central Bank of China, Republic of China (Taiwan)," has been
changed to "Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan)."
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a news statement that the change is aimed at
avoiding confusion and is consistent with international practices
in which the official name of a country is used when referring to
the central bank of that particular country.
</P>
<P>
The move comes amid the government's current efforts to change
the names of state-owned enterprises that contain references to
China.
</P>
<P>
In their respective board meetings held Friday, the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC Corp., Taiwan,
" China Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its name to "CSBC
Corp., Taiwan" and Chunghwa Post Co. decided to change its name
to "Taiwan Post Co."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet claims the name rectification campaign will help
avoid confusion resulting from Taiwan-based organizations
carrying similar names to organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that similar changes will
also be made to the names of the country's overseas embassies and
representative offices in the future.
