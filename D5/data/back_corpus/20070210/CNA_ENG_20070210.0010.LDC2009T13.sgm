UPU HAS NO COMMENT ON TAIWAN'S POSTAL NAME CHANGE ISSUE
</HEADLINE>

Geneva, Feb. 9 (CNA) 02/10/07  13:50:36 (By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)

The Berne-based Universal Postal Union (UPU) said Friday it is
not in a position to comment on Taiwan's decision to rename its
state-owned postal company to make it more recognizable in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the UPU focuses on upgrading global postal services,
setting relevant operation standards and coordinating the
worldwide postal system, the organization said it never
interferes with individual country's internal postal policies and
practices, such as postal charges and the issuing of stamps.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a UPU spokesman said, Taiwan is not a UPU member. The
UPU, a U.N. affiliate, has recognized the People's Republic of
China as the only legitimate Chinese representative since April
1972. The UPU now has 191 member countries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks amid reports that the labor union
of Taiwan's state-owned Chunghwa Post Co. -- Chunghwa means
"China" -- is protesting the company's decision to change its
name to Taiwan Post Co. and has warned its management that
redesignation might draw a backlash from China and lead to a
suspension of postal links across the Taiwan Strait and even with
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is not a UPU member, it has consistently followed
international norms and postal regulations and exercised self-
rule. The UPU spokesman said it could not make any comments on
the Taiwan postal company's name change issue. "As to other
countries' possible responses to such a move, it's up to Taiwan
to address them, " he added.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, the board of directors of Chunghwa Post Co. approved
the corporate name change Friday, despite protests from dozens of
labor union members on the grounds that the name rectification
would cost a lot of money and come at the expense of the
company's employees. The name change will take effect Monday when
a nameplate bearing the company's new name "Taiwan Post" will
also be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the boards of directors of two other state-owned
enterprises -- Chinese Petroleum Corp. and China Shipbuilding
Corp. -- approved similar redesignation proposals, removing
references to China and including "Taiwan" in their titles.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have criticized the name change policy as a
politically motivated move that will stir up ethnic disharmony or
confrontation, but government authorities argue that the policy
has been adopted based on the practical need to maintain "proper
partition" from China and save Taiwan's state-owned enterprises
from being confused with similarly named Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
Confusing titles between Taiwan and China are truly a problem for
foreign people. Just recently, the band of the Caribbean nation
Grenada played the national anthem of the "Republic of China"
(Taiwan's official title) instead of that of the "People's
Republic of China" at a ceremony welcoming visiting Chinese
President Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
The Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, elaborates on the special
phenomenon with regard to Taiwan's postal service and advises
readers to write "Taiwan" rather than "Republic of China" or
"ROC" on mail addressed to Taiwan to ensure the quickest
delivery.
</P>
<P>
The Wikipedia's UPU entry includes a paragraph that reads: "The
Republic of China joined the UPU on March 1, 1914. After the
People's Republic of China was founded, the Republic of China
continued to represent China in the UPU, until the UPU decided on
April 13, 1972 to recognize the People's Republic of China as the
only legitimate Chinese representative. This makes the
International Reply Coupons not available to Taiwan. Mail
addressed to Taiwan will still be delivered there, albeit routed
through a third country. However, writing 'Taiwan' rather than
'Republic of China' or 'ROC' ensures the quickest delivery.
Writing 'Taiwan, Province of China' may send the mail through
mainland China and cause delays."
