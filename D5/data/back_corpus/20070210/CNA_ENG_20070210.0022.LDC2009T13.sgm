Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin took part in a clean-up activity held
by the municipal government's Department of Environmental
Protection Saturday to promote the idea of keeping the city
clean, a department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the activity held in the city's Wenshan District on
the first day of a week-long national clean-up campaign launched
by the Environmental Protection Administration under the
Executive Yuan ahead of the Lunar New Year, Hau urged the city's
residents to take time out once a week to clean up the area in
around their residences to keep the city clean.

<P>
According to the spokesman, Hau said the clean-up activity is
meant to promote the concept of turning Taiwan into a "beautiful
Formosa" and noted that Singapore keeps its environment clean by
mobilizing half a million people in clean-up activities every
year and educating citizens on how to keep a clean environment.

The spokesman also reminded people that the city's garbage
collection times will change slightly during the Lunar New Year
period, with no garbage collection services from Feb. 18-20,
except at 57 specified collection locations at scheduled times.
</P>
<P>
The department will begin collecting general garbage and kitchen
waste from Feb. 21, and garbage collection operations will return
to normal from Feb. 23, the spokesman added. The Lunar New Year's
Day falls on Feb. 18 this year. endtiem/Li
