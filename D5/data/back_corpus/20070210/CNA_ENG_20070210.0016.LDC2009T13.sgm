</HEADLINE>

Washington,  Feb.  9 (CNA) 02/10/07  16:43:12 (By Jorge Liu and
Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
The United States called on President Chen Shui-bian Friday to
fulfill his "four noes" commitments, including not to change
Taiwan's national title, while expressing concern over Taiwan's
ongoing move to rectify the names of its state- owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen Shui-bian repeatedly has said he would not allow
either domestic or foreign pressure to alter the guarantees in
his 2000 inaugural  address,  in which he pledged not to declare
independence, not to change the national title, not to push for
inclusion of sovereignty themes in the Constitution, and not to
promote a referendum to change the status quo regarding
independence or unification, " the U.S. State Department said in
a written statement.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen's fulfillment of his commitments will be a test
of leadership, dependability and statesmanship, as well as
ability to protect Taiwan's interests, its relations with others,
and to maintain peace and stability in the strait," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued in response to a question raised during
the department's daily press briefing, in which spokesman Sean
McCormack was asked to comment on Taiwan's ongoing efforts to
rename state-owned enterprises that contain references to China
and plans to change  the names  of the country's overseas
embassies  and representative offices in the future.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the primary interest of the United States remains
maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the
State Department reiterated that the United States does not
support Taiwan independence and opposes any unilateral steps by
either side that would change the status quo.
</P>
<P>
"We do not support administrative steps by the Taiwan authorities
that would appear to change Taiwan's status unilaterally or move
toward independence. The United States does not, for instance,
support changes in terminology for entities administered by the
Taiwan authorities," it said.
</P>
<P>
In their respective  board meetings held Friday,  Taiwan's state-
owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC
Corp., Taiwan, " China Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its
name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan" and Chunghwa Post Co. decided to
change its name to "Taiwan Post Co."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet claims the name rectification campaign will help
avoid confusion resulting from Taiwan-based organizations
carrying similar names to organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
President Chen said Thursday that similar changes will also be
made to the names of the country's  overseas  embassies  and
representative offices in the future.
