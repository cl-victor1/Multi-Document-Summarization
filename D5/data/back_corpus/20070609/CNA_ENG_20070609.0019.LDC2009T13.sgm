Rotary International (RI) District 3520 will send 50 trained
teens aged 15-19 abroad this year for cultural exchanges, a
representative of the district said Saturday.

Hipo Chen, chairman of the district's Youth Exchange Program,
said the students from Taipei city and county have completed
their five-month training courses and will leave in August for
their host countries.

Among them, Chen said, 48 students are in long-term exchange
programs, with 18 heading for North America, 16 for Europe, three
for Japan and 11 to Central and South America. Two others are
bound for short-term exchange program, he added.

The students will stay at pre-arranged homestays and will learn
language and culture at local schools. Each of them will be given
a monthly allowance of US$100 during their stays abroad, Chen
said.

He said nearly 200 students from Taiwan and about 8,000 from
around the world are selected to join the program each year to
give them an international perspective.

District 3520 arranged hosting in Taiwan for 29 exchange students
from 11 countries last year, Chen said, adding that these
students will return to their own countries in June and July to
introduce Taiwan's culture to their homelands.
