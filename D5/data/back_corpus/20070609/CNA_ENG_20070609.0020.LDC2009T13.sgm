Taipei,  June  9 (CNA) 06/09/07  20:17:57 (By Lilian Wu)

The nation's top economic planner said Saturday that she will
call on Minister of Foreign Affairs James Hung to exchange views
on a government project aimed at encouraging investment in
Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) , was referring to the "co-prosperity" project
in the wake of Taiwan's announcement that it had severed
diplomatic ties with Costa Rica Thursday after the Central
American nation switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ho said the CEPD, which is in charge of the project, has examined
related investments following the severance of ties.
</P>
<P>
She said the CEPD will have to review whether Costa Rica's role
in the project is diminished or whether to increase investment in
other countries in Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
"The CEPD has no preset stance and will conduct  further
discussions with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, " she said,
adding that the council will work in tune with the country's
diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
The project was unveiled by President Chen Shui-bian in 2005 at
the fifth ROC- Central America summit meeting in Managua,
Nicaragua. Under the project, Taiwan earmarks US$250 million for
investment in the region, with the money coming from the
International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) and the
Executive Yuan's Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at helping Taiwan businessmen invest in
sectors with potential in Central and South America, with the
ceiling for government investment in each investment case set at
49 percent.
</P>
<P>
But officials said promotion of the project has not been smooth,
noting that so far, only Nien Hsing Textile has been approved to
invest in Nicaragua in late 2006,  with the Development Fund
earmarking NT$900 million and the ICDF earmarking NT$450 million.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they were elated that the first investment
under the project would take place, but Nien Hsing later backed
out, citing concern over market development in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, the co-prosperity project has not invested any of its
funds," they admitted.
