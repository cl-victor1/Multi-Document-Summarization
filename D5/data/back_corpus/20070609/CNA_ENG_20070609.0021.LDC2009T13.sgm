Two south-bound high speed trains departed from Taipei arrived at
their destinations more than 30 minutes late Saturday, and nearly
1,000 passengers received a 50 percent refund for the delay, the
Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) reported.
</P>
<P>
THSRC officials said that days of torrential rain have triggered
warning signals when trains passed Kueishan Station in Taoyuan
County, warning drivers to slow down when passing that station,
as well as the Miaoli section, where slopes supporting the
railway near the station had been eroded by flooding. A day
earlier, 4,500 passengers received a 50 percent or full refunds
due to the delays.

<P>
The officials said the Saturday train departed from Taipei at 7
a.m. and arrived at Taichung 47 minutes behind schedule. It
arrived at Zuoying 44 minutes behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
Another train departed from Taipei at 7: 30 a.m. and arrived at
Taichung station 31 minutes late, but made up the delay by
accelerating through the following south-bound stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the north-bound trains arrived at Banciao and Taipei
between two and five minutes behind schedule, they added.
</P>
<P>
The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung, inaugurated in
January, has reduced rail travel time between Taiwan's two
largest cities to 90 minutes from the previous four-and-a-half
hours.
