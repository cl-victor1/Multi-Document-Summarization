Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA) 02/23/07  21:57:54 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang took time during the Chinese New Year
holidays to pay a visit to a nursing home for veterans in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan Friday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the premier played snooker with some of the
veterans and wished them prosperity in the Year of Pig.
</P>
<P>
Su, widely considered a strong contender within the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)  to represent the party in the 2008
presidential election, was tightlipped when asked about when he
is going to announce his bid to enter the race.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said that his primary concern is to do his job well
in order to "live up to the expectations of the public."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, who announced Thursday that
he will take part in the party's primary for the next
presidential election, said that he will do everything he can to
win the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
"I have not considered the question of who would be my partner on
the ticket for the presidential election if I were to win the
primary, nor have I considered whether I would join another
winner of the primary on a ticket," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while paying a visit to a temple in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, where he distributed red envelops containing
cash to wellwishers.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that Taiwan is moving along the path of freedom and
democracy but that it has yet to become a "normal country."
</P>
<P>
He touted himself as the one who can best lead Taiwan out of its
difficulties to move forward and also the one who insists most on
"Taiwan-centric consciousness" and who is closest to the
"grassroots" public.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the Taiwan Society, a local pro-independence
group, later the same day, Yu also spoke of his campaign platform
of "making Taiwan into a normal country within a decade."
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he personally thinks becoming a "normal country"
involves rectification of the nation's official designation and
the crafting of a "timely, relevant and viable" constitution.
</P>
<P>
Other elements involved in making Taiwan into a normal country
will include gaining membership in the United Nations,
establishing a sufficient self-defense capability, and building a
sound economy to compete with other nations around the world.
