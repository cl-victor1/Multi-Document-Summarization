New Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san expressed Friday that
boosting the economy of the southern port city, attracting
investment, and luring more tourists are his three most "urgent
tasks" in his new position which he assumed two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Chiu, who holds a master's degree in law from National Taiwan
University, had served as a prosecutor, a lawyer, a legislator
and vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council before he was
appointed by Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu to serve as her deputy.
</P>
<P>
As a professional in the field of law, as well as finance and
economics, Chiu has been commissioned to work to boost the
economy of the country's second largest city, which also has the
island's largest port.
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, I'm expected to prevent Kaohsiung's economy
from becoming a target of criticism," Chiu told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said he thinks one of the urgent tasks is to attract
investment in local enterprises in Kaohsiung, adding that local
industries  should  be  upgraded and  developed  with  local
characteristics as part of efforts to maintain their
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He further said that he wants to develop the port city into a
"city of hope," where investors like to stay on.
</P>
<P>
Noting that tourism is also important to Kaohsiung's economy,
Chiu said he hopes that the city can become the last stop on the
itinerary of visitors touring attractions in central, eastern and
southern Taiwan, such as Alishan in Chiayi County, Sun Moon Lake
in Nantou County, and the Taroko National Park in Hualien County.
</P>
<P>
"Last night in Kaohsiung" will be the slogan for the city to
develop tourism, Chiu said, adding that he hopes that tourists
will also indulge in the pleasant experience of shopping in
Kaohsiung.
