The Nicaraguan government to be formed by President-elect Daniel
Ortega has decided to maintain diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China, President Chen Shui-bian said in the
Nicaraguan capital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ortega  disclosed  the information  while receiving  Chen's
delegation, who is in the Central American country to attend
Ortega's inauguration slated for Wednesday, Chen told Taiwan
reporters.

Nicaragua severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan at the start
of Ortega's first term in 1985. In the run-up to the latest
election, Ortega and his Sandinista party expressed the intention
of forging diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China.

<P>
Chen noted that the Sandinista party maintains very close
exchanges and interaction with the Communist Party of China (CPC)
and that representatives of both parties also met in Mexico to
discuss the possibility of restoring diplomatic relations between
their countries.

<P>
Despite Beijing's  desire to restore diplomatic  ties with
Nicaragua, Ortega's administration has decided to continue
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Ortega told Chen that the Sandinista party will continue to
maintain contact with the CPC and that the Nicaraguan government
also welcome the PRC to set up a trade office in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Also during the meeting, Ortega expressed hope that Nicaragua and
Taiwan will strengthen their cooperation after the new government
is formed, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Describing his visit to Nicaragua as a precious opportunity for
Taiwan to consolidate its friendship and substantial cooperation
with its diplomatic allies in Central America and the Caribbean
region, Chen said he will hold talks Wednesday and Thursday with
heads of state of these diplomatic allies who are also in
Nicaragua to attend Ortega's inauguration.

Meanwhile,  Chen said Nicaraguan Vice President-elect Jaime
Morales mentioned during the meeting with the Taiwan delegation
the new government's plan to convert the presidential palace into
a "home of Taiwan" for disadvantaged groups in Nicaragua.
