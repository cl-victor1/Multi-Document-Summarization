Northern Taiwan Institute of Science and Technology (NTIST) was
awarded by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Tuesday for its
efforts in cutting the number of student smokers down by two-
thirds, a school spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This marks the fourth year in a row that institute has received
such an award from the MOE, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education launched an award program more than a
decade ago to commend schools  that effectively  promote AIDS
prevention  and prevent students from abusing drugs,  smoking
cigarettes, as well as chewing beetle nuts.
</P>
<P>
The school uses creative and interactive methods of educating its
students about the harmful effects of drug abuse and smoking, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the school requires students who are caught smoking
to take a stop-smoking class for three hours on Sunday afternoon.
In addition, these students have to pick up cigarette butts on
campus and neighboring communities, the spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
The institute also asks a student club to perform at the nearby
junior high schools and elementary schools to warn students
against the dangers of smoking, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The measures have proven effective after several semesters, the
spokesman said, adding that in this semester, there have only
been 100 students caught smoking, marking a huge drop from the
figure of over 300 students last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the school holds a condom contest with a prize of
NT$5,000 as part of efforts to promote AIDS prevention, the
spokesman said. The contest has successfully attracted students'
attention and drawn a great number of students to participate, he
added.
