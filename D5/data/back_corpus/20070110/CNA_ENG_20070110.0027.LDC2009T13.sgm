Managua,   Nicaragua,  Jan.  9  (CNA) 01/10/07  20:10:36 (By Wen
Kuei-hsiang and Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed satisfaction Tuesday with his
latest telephone dialogue with Washington officials during his
recent transit stop in San Francisco en route to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Sharing his views with Taiwan reporters after arriving in the
Central American nation, Chen described the 40-minute dialogue as
"the best ever" for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he was impressed with the welcome from the Washington
officials.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan and the United States must cherish their
friendship and should not damage their hard-won mutual trust,
Chen reiterated that his commitment to the U.S. government and
President George W. Bush will not change.
</P>
<P>
He said he was very happy to meet with former U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Perry, American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Raymond Burghardt and Donald McQuade, vice chancellor of the
University of California at Berkeley, and to exchange views with
members of Congress over the telephone during his stopover.
</P>
<P>
On the late announcement of his plan to visit Nicaragua for the
inauguration of Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel Ortega, Chen
said it was because the plan could only be finalized after his
transit stops in the United States had been properly arranged.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the government was concerned as to whether the
U.S. government would agree to his request to make a stopover in
the continental United States and to be allowed to leave the
airport during the transit stops. Chen was denied permission to
stop over in the continental U.S. on a Latin America visit last
May.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the trip was made possible after Bush decided last
Friday to allow him to stay overnight in San Francisco en route
to Nicaragua and to transit in Los Angeles on his way back to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Denying he was trying to mend fences with Washington by stopping
over the United States, Chen said Taiwan has maintained good
interaction and communication with the U.S. government over the
past six months and that both sides are confident that their
relations will continue to develop in a positive direction.
