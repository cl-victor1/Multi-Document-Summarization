Managua, Nicaragua Jan. 9 (CNA) 01/10/07  12:52:51 (By Wen Kuei-

<P>
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian arrived in Nicaragua
Tuesday for a three-day visit during which he will attend the
inauguration of Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel Ortega.
</P>
<P>
Chen was greeted by Nicaraguan government officials in a formal
welcome ceremony upon his arrival at the Managua International
Airport, with a large group of Taiwanese expatriates also on hand
to welcome the president.
</P>
<P>
In addition to attending the inauguration of Ortega, Chen will
meet with outgoing Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos and
receive Nicaraguan Vice President-elect Jaime Morales during his
stay in the Central American nation, Presidential Office
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chen will also hold talks with heads of state of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Latin America and sign a joint declaration
after the meeting, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his arrival in Nicaragua, Chen made a stopover in San
Francisco, where he met with American Institute in Taiwan
Chairman Raymond Burghardt and former U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Perry and exchanged views with major members of the U.S.
Congress over telephone.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Shih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, Burghardt expressed concerns about the
progress on Taiwan's planned procurement of an arms package from
the United States and said he hopes to visit Taiwan again after
the Lunar New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Perry, who served in the administration of former U.S.
President Bill Clinton, also expressed concerns about the arms
procurement package.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the cross-Taiwan Strait missile crisis that
occurred during the run-up to Taiwan's first popular presidential
election in 1996, Perry said it was the right decision for the
Clinton administration to send three aircraft carriers to the
Taiwan Strait at that time, because Taiwan's democratic elections
are equally important to Taiwan and the United States, according
to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Chen will make a transit stop in Los Angeles Jan. 12 on his way
back to Taipei from Nicaragua.
