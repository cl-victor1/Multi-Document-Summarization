JAPAN SUCCUMBS TO CHINESE PRESSURE OVER DORM ISSUE: KMT LAWMAKER

Taipei,  March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  17:53:09 (By Deborah Kuo)

Blasting a Japanese highest court ruling in favor of Beijing with
regard to a legal battle between Taiwan and China over the
ownership of a student dormitory in Kyoto, an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) legislator said Wednesday that the Japanese
government had succumbed to China's pressure by obliterating
truth and facts.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Shao-ping, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said the
unfair ruling underscores the fact that Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe has succumbed to Beijing's pressure in anxiety to mend
China-Japan relations, which were not cordial during the tenure
of his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi.
</P>
<P>
Japan's highest court overturned two lower court rulings and
returned the case to the Kyoto District Court Tuesday, saying
that the government in Taipei lost its right to claim ownership
of the property, known in Taiwan as the Kuanghualiao and which
belonged to the Republic of China, after Japan switched
diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The ruling runs counter to judicial justice and independence,
according to Hsu.
</P>
<P>
Hsu attributed the adverse development of the legal battle partly
to the Chen Shui-bian administration's push for a change of the
country's national designation aimed at relegating the Republic
of China to history.
</P>
<P>
"How could Taiwan expect the international community to respect
the name of the ROC when Taiwan does not recognize the title
itself?" Hsu asked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fei Hung-tai, a deputy whip of the KMT legislative
caucus, declared that the KMT caucus condemns the Japanese
ruling, saying that it is unacceptable that the Japanese
government scoops a huge fortune from Taiwanese tourists and
traders every year while "cold-bloodedly strangling Taiwan" on
the diplomatic front.
</P>
<P>
Fei also accused the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of negligence.
</P>
<P>
The property at the center of the dispute was bought in 1952 from
Kyoto University by the ROC government in Taipei, which at that
time was recognized by Japan as the sole legitimate
representative of China.
</P>
<P>
Ownership of the dormitory became an issue of contention after
Japan severed diplomatic relations with Taipei and recognized
Beijing in 1972.
</P>
<P>
At the first two trials of the case, both the Kyoto District
Court and the Osaka High Court ruled in favor of the Taipei
government.
</P>
<P>
Taipei has pointed out that the ROC government was exercising
effective jurisdiction over Taiwan when it bought the student
dormitory in 1952, a fact has remained unchanged ever since.
</P>
<P>
It has further argued that the ROC continues to exist, that it
has never been ruled by the communist regime of the People's
Republic of China and that the ROC, represented by its National
Property Bureau, has the right to file claim over the ownership
of the property.
