Taipei, March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  16:01:15 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan welcomes any U.S. advocacy or proposals that are conducive
to cross- Taiwan Strait peace and regional stability, but also
hopes that the United States will not forget its commitments to
Taiwan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on remarks by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Thomas Christensen a day
earlier on the U.S. stance on Taiwan and cross-strait relations,
Wang said Taiwan and the United States have maintained a firm
consensus on efforts to secure cross-strait peace and maintain
status quo in the strait.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Taiwan is pleased to see that the Bush administration
remains resolute in observing the Taiwan Relations Act, under
which the U.S. will continue to help Taiwan defend itself, adding
that all efforts that help bolster cross- strait peace and
regional stability are welcomed by Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing,
Christensen said the Bush administration's cross-strait policy
has remained unchanged from those of the previous U.S.
administrations and that the U.S. will fulfill its commitments
under the Taiwan Relations Act by offering military items of a
defensive nature to Taiwan and also by maintaining the United
States' own capabilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Christensen  added that China's  lack of transparency  and
deviousness in its ever-increasing military spending is
detrimental to itself and he urged the Chinese leadership to cut
the number of missiles it has targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that China has enacted its Anti-Secession  Law
targeting Taiwan, has kept increasing the number of ballistic
missiles aimed at Taiwan and has continued to add budget for
military build-up, making itself the only predator undermining
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to face China's efforts to
alter the status quo, which he said could also jeopardize
regional peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific area.
