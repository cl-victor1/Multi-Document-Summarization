WASHINGTON TAKES CHEN'S 'FIVE NOES' PLEDGES SERIOUSLY: U.S.
OFFICIAL

Washington,  March 27 (CNA) 03/28/07  12:39:45 (By Jorge Liu,
Chiehyu Lin and Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
The United States takes seriously ROC President Chen Shui-bian's
commitments to U.S. President George W. Bush not to move in the
direction of unilateral changes to the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait and Taiwan's status, Thomas Christensen, U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs hearing,
Christensen said that Washington takes seriously Chen's
commitments made in his two inaugural speeches that the U.S.
administration believes are stabilizing commitments.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that that's a sign of Chen's leadership, and we
believe that the situation across the Taiwan Strait has been
stable because the president and the Bush administration at large
has been very firm and very consistent in stating our full one
China policy, which calls for peaceful resolution across the
Taiwan Strait and says that we do not support Taiwan
independence; that we oppose unilateral changes to the status
quo; and we expect the two sides to resolve their differences in
a peaceful manner," Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
Christensen noted that the United States expects President Chen
to abide by these pledges, adding that it considers the "four
wishes" remarks concerning Taiwan independence that President
Chen spelled out earlier this year to be "unhelpful and
inconsistent" with those earlier pledges.
</P>
<P>
"We look to him to abide by those commitments that he's made
because we believe they're a source for stability in cross-strait
relations," Christensen further said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christensen stressed that the Bush administration's
cross-strait policy has remained unchanged from those of the
previous U.S. administrations.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, he continued, "I'll say to you what I've
said to so many others: Taiwan has no better friend than the
United States. It has no better friend than the Bush
administration. And we pay very careful attention to Taiwan's
security needs. We take extremely seriously, and we work to
fulfill our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act by
offering military items of a defensive nature to Taiwan and also
by maintaining our own capabilities in the region."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christensen said that the U.S. government hopes Taiwan
considers its self-defense seriously and hopes that various
Taiwanese elites do not play political football with Taiwan's
security.
</P>
<P>
Noting that for political reasons on the island, Taiwan has not
procured some of the key items in the defense package that
President Bush offered to sell to Taiwan in April 2001,
Christensen said "this is a core interest of the United States,
and we let the Taiwan public know that -- we take that extremely
seriously."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan should come up with a long-term plan for its security
that is a bit removed from the political to and fro on the
island, " he said.
