SUPERMARKETS MUST REDUCE PLASTIC PACKAGING: EPA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  20:25:52 (By Y.C. Jou)
</P>
<P>
Hypermarts and supermarkets must reduce their use of plastic
packaging for fresh foods by 15 percent within one year from July
1, or be subject to fines of up to NT$150,000 (US$ 4,500) , the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the reduction measure include the often seen
plastic boxes and trays for eggs, meat, seafood, vegetables,
fruits and bakery, said Ho Soon- ching, head of the EPA's
Department of Waste Management.
</P>
<P>
According to EPA tallies, nationwide such packaging produces 233
metric tons of waste each month. The new measure is expected to
reduce that waste by 35 tons per month in the first year of
implementation, and 58 tons in the second year, Ho said.

<P>
Ho said the EPA had planned to entirely ban such packaging in
hypermarts and supermarkets but faced opposition from the
industry. Therefore, the EPA adopted a Korean model focusing on
gradual reduction, she said.
</P>
<P>
She suggested, for example, that the common practice of packing
even just two carrots with a plastic tray plus shrink wrap can be
easily changed to the use of shrink wrap only or entirely doing
away with wrapping.
