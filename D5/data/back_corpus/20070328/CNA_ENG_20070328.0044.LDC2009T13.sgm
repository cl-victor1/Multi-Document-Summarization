Controversial television footage showing a gangster flaunting
firearms and threatening to kill a rival was found to have been
shot by a TV news reporter, the TVBS network said Wednesday after
sacking the reporter responsible and his local chief.
</P>
<P>
In a statement apologizing to its audience, TVBS said Shih Chen-
kang, the TV station's reporter stationed in Nantou County, and
his superior,  Chang Yu-kun, who was TVBS's  central  Taiwan
correspondent, lied to the editorial office in stating that the
video disk had been provided by an unknown source.
</P>
<P>
An investigation initiated by the TV station forced the two to
admit that they lied out of concerns for their safety, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said by concealing the truth, the two journalists
had misled the editorial office into airing the footage, adding
that the TV station is sorry for its failuresin the exercise of
supervision and enforcement of discipline.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Communications Commission (NCC) said TVBS
is not justified by shifting responsibility to the journalists.
</P>
<P>
The TV station should have handed the intimidation video over to
the police when receiving it,NCC Counselor Yang Ying-lan said.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that according to the Satellite Broadcasting Act,
satellite TV stations may be fined up to NT$2 million and have
their broadcasting license suspended for a period ranging from
three days to three months if their program seriously violates
public order and good morals.
</P>
<P>
Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang also
condemned the TVBS's role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Chou Cheng-pao, a 33-year-old Taichung criminal, has appeared on
several TV broadcasts since late Monday. During the video
statement, Chou sits behind a table on which two M-16 rifles and
two handguns are displayed.
</P>
<P>
In the footage, Chou claimed responsibility for three recent
shootings that injured his former gang boss, Liu Juey-jung, and
two accomplices.
</P>
<P>
He accused Liu of masterminding the March 23 murder of gangster
Lin Chen-hsing and betraying his followers. Controversially, at
the time of the shooting, Lin was out on bail for his role in a
kidnapping of Taichung City Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien in
2001.
