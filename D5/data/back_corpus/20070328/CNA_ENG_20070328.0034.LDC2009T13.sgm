Seoul,  March 28 (CNA) 03/28/07  20:27:47 (By Chiang Yuan-chen
and T.C. Jiang)

<P>
A Taiwanese official stationed in South Korea has urged both
countries to increase industrial cooperation in order to achieve
mutually beneficial outcomes.
</P>
<P>
Yao Hung-cheng,  an economic  division  chief  at Taiwan's
representative office in South Korea, made the call in his
address to Taiwanese and South Korean trade officials and
business people at a meeting held in Seoul Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yao pointed out that Taipei and Seoul have similar developed
economies  and trade patterns,  as well as similar industrial
structures.
</P>
<P>
Both faced with the emerging threat of industrial hollowing-out,
Taiwan and South Korea should work together more closely to
generate wealth benefiting people in both countries, Yao noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, South Korea is Taiwan's fifth largest trading partner,
the sixth largest export market, the fourth largest source of
imports, and source of Taiwan's second largest trade deficit, Yao
said.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral trade only accounts for four percent of the
value of each other's total exports, Yao stressed, adding that
this shows there is still much room for development.
</P>
<P>
Yao called on Taiwanese businessmen to expand their exports to
South Korea, and South Korean businessmen to increase their
purchases from Taiwan, while promising that Taiwan will offer any
necessary assistance.
