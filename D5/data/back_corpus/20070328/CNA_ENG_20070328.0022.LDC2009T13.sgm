Forensic tests on hair samples from controversial television show
host Hu Gua and his girlfriend Ting Ro-an have detected evidence
of marijuana smoking, an executive officer of the Bureau of
Investigation (BOI) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huang, in charge of the BOI sixth department, revealed the
test results at a press conference, saying the results show that
Hu smoked marijuana between last September and last November,
while Ting took the drug during the period between last November
and January.
</P>
<P>
The tests were conducted after MOI inspectors found marijuana and
a pipe at Hu's residence in downtown Taipei last Friday in a
search for evidence related to a bribery probe.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office ordered the search after
receiving an anonymous tipoff claiming that Hu had bribed a
district judge for his acquittal in a gambling fraud case.
