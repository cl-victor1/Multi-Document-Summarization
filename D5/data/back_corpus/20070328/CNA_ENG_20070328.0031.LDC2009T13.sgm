ARSENIC LEVELS HIGHER IN CENTRAL TAIWAN SCIENCE PARK

With more manufacturers having moved into the Central Taiwan
Science Park and begun mass production, the arsenic levels around
the park have risen, the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EPA made the remarks after recent allegations by
environmental groups that a building at the nearby Tunghai
University recorded a maximum arsenic level of 37.4 nanograms per
cubic meter, which they said is so high it can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said several major manufacturers, including
comprehensive memory provider ProMOS, leading TFT-LCD panel
producer AUO, and Winbond Electronics Corp., are possibly the
source of the higher levels.
</P>
<P>
The EPA conducted a survey on the area around the Central Taiwan
Science Park in February, which showed that the arsenic level in
the air was lower than in 2006, but still higher than in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the level is within the safety range, but
added that the EPA will help manufacturers to address pollution
problems in production processes.
</P>
<P>
Chou Shu-wan, section chief of the EPA's Department of Air
Quality Protection and Noise Control, said the international
community has yet to set a minimum standard for arsenic levels in
the air.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to assuage public misgivings, the EPA will convene
a meeting with representatives from the northern, central and
southern Taiwan science parks Thursday to communicate with them
on adopting low-arsenic or no-arsenic production processes.
</P>
<P>
The goal is aimed at achieving an arsenic level of under six
nanograms, which the European Union is set to put into practice
in 2013, Chou said.
