Taipei,  May  14 (CNA) 05/15/07  10:39:21 (By Sofia Wu)

The new Cabinet to be headed by Chang Chun-hsiung,  a senior
legislator  who has also led Taiwan's quasi-official intermediary
body dealing with exchanges with China, will be sworn in May 21,
Executive Yuan spokeswoman Chen Mei-ling said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang will lead a total of
83 political appointees to resign en masse Wednesday, Chen said,
adding that the Cabinet will thereafter become a caretaker one
that will refrain from making any major policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
The change of command at the helm of the Executive Yuan follows
Su's offer to resign last weekend, less than a week after his
surprise defeat in the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party's
presidential primary for the 2008 election.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian appointed Chang, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), earlier in the day to succeed Su.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who as SEF chairman is Taiwan's top negotiator with China,
is expected to form an "aggressive action" Cabinet to maintain
political stability, internal unity and economic prosperity in
the run-up to the next presidential  election to help the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party consolidate its grip on power.
