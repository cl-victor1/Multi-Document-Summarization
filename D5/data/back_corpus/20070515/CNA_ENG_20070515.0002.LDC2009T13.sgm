WHO BID BRINGS SPOTLIGHT TO TAIWAN PEOPLE'S HEALTH RIGHTS: DOH
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  09:42:15 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as a
full member has helped bring spotlight to issues regarding Taiwan
people's health rights, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou
Sheng-mao said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hou, who is currently in Geneva to drum up support for Taiwan's
WHO bid, made the remarks in a telephone interview after the
World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making arm --
decided Monday not to consider membership for Taiwan during its
ongoing annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 148-17 with two abstentions, the WHA approved a
Russian motion against inclusion of discussion of Taiwan's
membership bid into the agenda of its weeklong annual conference
that began Monday.
</P>
<P>
While most countries voted for the Russian motion, Hou said
health ministers from many major countries, such as the United
States, Japan, Canada and European Union members states, voiced
support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in WHO activities
and recognized Taiwan people's health rights in their speeches
delivered after the vote.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 180-plus health ministers from countries around the
world, more than 40 spoke for Taiwan's cause after the vote, "
Hou said, adding that topics related to Taiwan people's health
rights were the only focus of the WHA's Monday afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Hou said the WHO bid has helped draw world
attention to the injustice Taiwan has endured in its exclusion
from the WHO health service system.
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, Taiwan has unsuccessfully sought observer
status at the WHA. This year, it went a step further to seek full
membership in the WHO.
</P>
<P>
As the WHA already spent its whole Monday afternoon session
debating Taiwan's membership and health issues, Hou said Taiwan's
application for WHA observership is not expected to be addressed
again before the assembly concludes its annual session May 23.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hou said he and other Taiwan officials and medical
professionals will stay in Geneva in the coming days to continue
pushing for Taiwan's dignified  coverage  in the WHO-sponsored
International Health Regulations (IHR) and the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network (GOARN).
</P>
<P>
According to a secret memorandum of understanding signed between
the WHO Secretariat and China in 2005, all official
communications between the WHO and Taiwan must be addressed to
China. Hou said such arrangements have not only undermined
Taiwan's sovereign status but would also jeopardize Taiwan's
ability to cope with major medical emergencies and create gaps in
the global health monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
Hou said Taiwan will strive to have its Center for Disease
Control (Taiwan CDC) become the IHR and GOARN's liaison window
for direct contact for implementation of relevant stipulations
and epidemic control measures in the Taiwan area.
