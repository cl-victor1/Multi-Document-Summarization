PRESIDENT, WOULD-BE DPP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SET TONE ON KEY
ISSUES

Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  20:29:42 (By Lilian Wu)

President Chen Shui-bian and former Premier Frank Hsieh, who is
set to be nominated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to run in the 2008 presidential election, set the tone on
several key issues during a recent meeting, DPP lawmakers close
to Hsieh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said that both Chen and Hsieh concurred that their mission
is to keep the DPP in power in the 2008 presidential election and
the two reached a consensus on three major issues -- cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, the diplomatic front and the members of the
presidential campaign team -- during the meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On cross-strait relations, Hsieh has accepted Chen's suggestion
that "both sides of the Taiwan Strait can engage in any kind of
pragmatic opening and contact as long as they do not compromise
Taiwan's sovereignty and dignity."
</P>
<P>
This tone has rekindled public hope of allowing the Olympic torch
to pass through Taiwan, which was earlier rejected on the grounds
that it would enter Taiwan via Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and
leave for China-control Hong Kong, instead of entering and
exiting Taiwan via somewhere other than China.
</P>
<P>
On the diplomatic front, Hsieh is expected to visit the United
States and Japan at the end of June to meet officials of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
This will allow the international community to learn more about
Hsieh's ideals for running the country as well as broaden his own
horizons.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Hsieh also agreed that the presidential campaign team
will recruit talent in an "open manner." They will recruit
political appointees after they step down from their current
government posts, as well as legislators who have withdrawn from
the DPP's legislative primary, and even opposition legislators
who have lost their party's primary.
