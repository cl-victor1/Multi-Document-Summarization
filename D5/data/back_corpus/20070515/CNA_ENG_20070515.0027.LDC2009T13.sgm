TAIWAN TAKES STEP FORWARD IN WHO MEMBERSHIP BID: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  19:41:41 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that Taiwan has made a step
forward in its efforts to join the World Health Organization
(WHO) , as its WHO membership bid issue was extensively discussed
in the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the
WHO's decision-making arm.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the Presidential Office to a group of
government overseas mission chiefs who returned for a home visit
after WHA member states decided a day earlier not to discuss the
country's application to enter the WHO as a full member under the
name of "Taiwan" by a vote of 148 to 17 on the first day of the
WHA week-long 60th annual conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the country had pursued full WHO
membership, rather than observer status in the WHA, under the
name of "Taiwan" in a decade.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that Taiwan's WHO membership bid will not be gained
easily, Chen said that he has strong confidence that the
objective will be achieved as long as "we insist on doing the
right thing."
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, the president said, the government plans
to file an application in September to join the United Nations in
the name of "Taiwan, " so as to allow the international community
to hear the voices of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he was pleased to hear that Taiwan's WHO bid
application stirred up debate in the WHA annual conference after
being briefed the previous night by officials from the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and the National Security Council on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Despite rejection by WHA member states to include the issue on
their annual conference agenda, Chen still described the latest
setback as a "successful first step."
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of Taiwan from the WHO reflects that the issue is
not a purely one of "public health, " Chen pointed out, adding
that Taiwan would have been granted a seat if it were simply a
health or quarantine issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the key point lies in the U. N.'s reluctance
to recognize Taiwan's statehood.  Stressing that Taiwan is an
independent sovereign state, Chen said that the U. N.'s refusal
to recognize Taiwan could never affect Taiwan's statehood.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's WHA session, the United States, the European
Union,  Japan  and Canada  all supported  Taiwan's  meaningful
participation in the WHO and its technical meetings as an
observer.
