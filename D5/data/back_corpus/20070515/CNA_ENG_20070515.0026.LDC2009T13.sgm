Chiayi  County,  May  15  (CNA) 05/15/07  19:22:19 (By Han Nai-

<P>
Ma Ying-jeou, the presidential nominee of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , defended Tuesday a bicycle tour he is making
around Taiwan, claiming that the publicity stunt has enabled him
to make contact with people at the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
Ma, former chairman of the KMT, and a 30-man entourage began the
round-the- island tour from Oluanpi, the southernmost tip of
Taiwan, five days ago.
</P>
<P>
The 619-km journey will take the group through 18 cities and
counties on Taiwan's western plain and enable Ma to meet with
people in all sectors before ending up at Taipei County's Fukuei
Cape, the northernmost tip of Taiwan, May 20.
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism that they looked like "members of the
nobility on an outing" who could not possibly be close to
ordinary citizens, Ma described the bicycle journey as the "most
dynamic way" of keeping contact with Taiwan's public.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his critics did not understand the real situation
and were looking at Taiwan's issues purely from the viewpoint of
people in northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that riding 16 hours a day on a bicycle was a great
challenge to his stamina, but added that he was able to sleep
well and maintain high spirits despite sore leg muscles.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his blog has received many positive comments about
his bike journey, Ma invited his critics to access his blog and
share his feelings about the trip.
