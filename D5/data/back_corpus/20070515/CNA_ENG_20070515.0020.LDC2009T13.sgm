Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) modules with a concentration
rate of 500 times have been developed by a research team at the
Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) under the Cabinet-
level Atomic Energy Council, INER sources reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Along with the new CPV modules, INER has also completed a high-
efficiency, high- precision sunlight tracking module, they noted,
adding that combining the CPV module with the tracking module can
provide a much higher power generation efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The CPV and tracking module production technologies will be
transferred to 14 contracted local manufacturers in a "CPV
Strategic Alliance" as soon as possible, with a goal of boosting
the production value of Taiwan's CPV industry by billions of NT
dollars by 2010, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the institute, a three-year development roadmap has
been arranged to facilitate the vision -- namely, to install a
laboratory for CPV solar cell modules by the end of 2007, to
establish  a certification  system for one- megawatt  CPV power
generators in 2008, and to help the lab win accreditation by the
Certification Body Testing Laboratory in 2009.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the institute is also working on a
refinement project to raise the conversion efficiency of solar
cells from 31 percent to 45 percent to further increase Taiwan's
edge in the CPV area.
