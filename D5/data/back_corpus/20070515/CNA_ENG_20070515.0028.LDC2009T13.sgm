TAIWAN UNBOWED IN WHO MEMBERSHIP BID: FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  19:46:13 (By Flor Wang)

Despite Taiwan's latest setback in its World Health Organization
(WHO) membership bid, the government will not give up its efforts
to make the country a member of the world body, Minister of
Foreign Affairs James Huang said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks after member states of the World Health
Assembly (WHA), the WHO's decision-making arm, ruled out a
proposal a day earlier to discuss Taiwan's application to enter
the WHO during the first day of its week-long 60th annual
conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in a decade that the country sought to join
the WHO under the name of "Taiwan" as a full member,  although
WHA member states decided not to include the proposal on the
conference's agenda for further discussions by a vote of 148-17.
</P>
<P>
Two of Taiwan's diplomatic allies -- Nicaragua and Marshall
Islands -- were absent from the session, ministry officials said,
pointing out that it is worth noting that Costa Rica, another of
Taiwan's 25 diplomatic partners, voted "no."
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, it is not surprising that the
United States, the European Union and Japan cast "no" votes
against discussions for Taiwan's WHO membership. Despite this,
the government is poised to continue with the bid, they added.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States cast a "no" vote due to its "one
China" policy, Huang said that Washington later still voiced its
backing for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the WHO as an
observer.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the United States is quite friendly toward Taiwan and
has adopted  a balancing  attitude  regarding  this  country's
participation in the WHO," Huang explained.
</P>
<P>
As for Japan's "no" vote, ministry officials said that Japan had
earlier informed Taiwan that its position was due to a thaw in
Tokyo-Beijing relations.
