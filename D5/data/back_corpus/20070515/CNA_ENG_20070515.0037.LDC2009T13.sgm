TERM

Taipei, May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  22:08:03 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) filed a
lawsuit with the special investigation unit of the Supreme Court
Prosecutors' Office Tuesday, accusing President Chen Shui-bian of
embezzling public funds during his term as Taipei mayor from 1994
to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office responded by expressing "deep regret"
over what it described as a false accusation by the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsu Shao-ping, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus,
filed the suit alleging that Chen used special mayoral funds to
pay utility bills and buy flowers for his personal residence
while he was Taipei mayor.
</P>
<P>
Hsu urged State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming to let
prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen -- one of nine prosecutors in the special
investigation unit -- to investigate the case, so that he can
apply the same standards he is using in the embezzlement case
against former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Presidential Office pointed out that Chen and
his family lived in their own house during his four years as
Taipei mayor and not in an official residence.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that it was lawful to ask the city government to pay the
water, electricity, gas and flower bills for the mayor, the
spokesman claimed that the KMT is trying to "mislead" the public.
</P>
<P>
The president  and his wife  have  been named  as "joint
perpetrators" in another embezzlement case involving his alleged
misuse of special Presidential Office funds designated for use in
state affairs.
</P>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen and three presidential aides have been on
trial at the Taipei District Court since December last year,
although the president is protected by the Constitution from
prosecution until his term ends in May 2008.
