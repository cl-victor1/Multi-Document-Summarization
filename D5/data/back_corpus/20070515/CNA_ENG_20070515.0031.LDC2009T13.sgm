<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will continue to monitor
price fluctuation of major consumer products amid reports that
the prices of many products have risen recently.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department under the MOEA said that if they detect
any abnormal fluctuations, they will report them to the Fair
Trade Commission and the Consumer Protection Commission.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Department officials visit convenience  stores and
supermarkets every month to check price fluctuations of 100 major
consumer products.
</P>
<P>
In their investigation in early May, they found that prices of
instant noodles and cooking oil had risen by between 2.6 percent
and 5.3 percent, mainly to reflect a surge in the cost of raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, while the prices of some products might not have
changed, portions of items such as bread and tissue paper might
have been made smaller, so that in real terms, prices of such
items have in fact increased, the officials said.
