AIR FORCE OFFICER PRAISES PILOTS' 'HEROIC DECISION'

Taipei,  May 15 (CNA) 05/15/07  17:29:54 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

The two co-pilots of the F-5F jet fighter that crashed during an
exercise last week missed the opportunity to eject to safety
because they chose not to let the stalled plane go down in a
residential area, a spokesman for the Air Force said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Air Force Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Liu Chen-wu praised that it
was a "heroic decision."
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at a press conference at the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) while releasing the preliminary results of
the investigation by the Air Force into the accident. The jet
fighter crashed into a military base in Hukou, Hsinchu County in
northern Taiwan, killing both pilots as well as two Singaporean
troops on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The crash caused a fire at the barracks housing Singapore Armed
Forces (SAF) soldiers participating in a training program. Nine
other SAF soldiers were injured, sustaining varying degrees of
burns, with two of them in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that a plane crash tends to be caused by either
environmental factors, mechanical problems or human error, or a
combination of all these factors.
</P>
<P>
He said the investigators have concluded that the F-5F pilots --
instructor Maj. Wei Tzu-yuan and intelligence officer Capt. Chang
Chia-chun -- failed to pull up safely immediately after firing
their guns and releasing bombs during a rehearsal for the Han
Kuang 23 military exercises, adding that low visibility may have
misled the pilots when they calculated their altitude.
</P>
<P>
The result was that the aircraft stalled and crashed, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
As to what caused the low visibility on such a clear day, Liu
said that the investigators blame the smoke and dust stirred up
by ground troops firing their guns during the rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
Although the F-5F jet fighter had undergone regular checks and
had been in good condition over the past half year, Liu said, it
is still possible that the plane experienced mechanical problems,
adding that problems with the plane's engine could have been a
key factor in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said that a thorough examination of the plane
wreckage will have to be conducted to determine whether
mechanical problems were a factor in the accident.
