The military will begin a four-day live-fire drill of its annual
Han Kuang 23 exercise Tuesday with three types of Air Force
fighters practicing emergency landings and takeoffs on a freeway
in western Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
MND officials said two each of the three types of fighters -- the
F16, the Mirage-2000 and the IDF -- will practice their combat
readiness on the Huatan section of the Sun Yat-sen Freeway, which
will be temporarily closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
It will mark the first time in 29 years the three types of
fighters -- which form the backbone of the Air Force arsenal --
will have honed their skills at the same time, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the live-fire drill will be staged in Penghu,
Changhua, Yilan, Hsinchu, Taichung and Pingtung. This year's
military exercise will be the largest in terms of areas covered
and number of participants involved.
</P>
<P>
In addition to inviting Taiwan's diplomatic allies, the
government has also arranged personnel from the United States,
Japan and the Philippines to observe the drills, the officials
said.

<P>
The Air Force practiced emergency landing and takeoff on four
sections of the Sun Yat-sen Freeway in 1978 when the freeway was
newly built to test the conversion of freeway sections to runways
in wartime.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, 2004, the air force also arranged for two mirage
fighters to practice on a section of the Sun Yat-sen Freeway
during the Han Kuang 20 exercises.
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials said that in addition to practicing the
emergency landings and takeoffs, they have also practiced
installing logistic and support systems near the relevant
sections of freeway.
