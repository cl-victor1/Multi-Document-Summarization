A local graduate student has won a bronze prize in the
competition for iF Design Awards, a renowned German award handed
out annually since 1953, with his innovative "Blind Touch" -- a
gadget for the visually impaired combining a keyboard for the
blind, a voice recorder, and a Braille slate, academic sources
reported Tuesday.

The gadget, designed by Huang Chun-chiang who is a student at the
Graduate School of Design of National Taiwan University of
Science and Technology (NTUST) , is meant to help the visually
impaired by offering a user-friendly input interface and a voice
recorder that allows them to communicate verbally with greater
ease, the sources said.

According to NTUST, the bronze award in the "Assisted Living"
category of the "iF Lebens(t)raeume" comes with a monetary grant,
which when combined with a NT$500,000 (US$14,976) grant offered
by Taiwan's Ministry of Education totals more than NT$1 million.

NTUST officials noted that besides Huang, two other students at
the Graduate School of Design did great in the iF Design Award
competition and another international designing competition for
the Braun Prize 2007.

The two students, each with an individual design, made it to the
finals after competing against 941 designs from all over the
world, the officials said, adding that one of the students has
won a contract with a local manufacturer to market his design in
Japan by 2008.
