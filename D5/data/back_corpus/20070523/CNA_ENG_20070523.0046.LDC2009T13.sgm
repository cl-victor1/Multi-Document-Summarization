<P>
Taiwan received export orders totaling US$27.46 billion in April,
the second- highest figure for a single month, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure also represented an increase of 11.27 percent year-on-
year, MOEA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan received export orders totaling US$103.34 billion in the
first fourth months of this year, up 12.34 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of export items, information and telecommunications
products made the biggest contribution, increasing by US$850
million, or up 16.72 percent from the same month of last year,
mainly because demand for notebook computers was strong and
international companies continued to subcontract orders to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the region, Taiwan received orders from China and
Hong Kong totaling US$7.26 billion in April, ahead of orders of
US$6.81 billion from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan received export orders worth US$26.21 billion from China
and Hong Kong in the first quarter, also ahead of US$26.1 billion
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
But MOEA officials said the ratio of production overseas also
climbed. The ratio of production overseas reached 45.64 percent
in April, setting a single-month high.
</P>
<P>
The officials estimated that foreign orders will continue to
increase thanks to steady economic growth in Japan and Europe and
the strong demands of emerging economies in Asia, which will
offset the negative impact brought about by a slowed U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with the fact that the new Taiwan dollar has
continued to be weak against major currencies, will continue to
fuel exports, the officials added.
