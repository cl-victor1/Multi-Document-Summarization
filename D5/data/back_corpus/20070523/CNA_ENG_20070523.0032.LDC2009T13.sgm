Taipei, May  23 (CNA) 05/23/07  19:00:02 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Experimental composer Andre van Rensburg could have easily scored
another success with his new album "Concrete" in his home country
of South Africa, but has chosen to record and release the new
album in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg, who has composed extensively for experimental
theater, dance and film, has chosen to live and work in Taipei
after a visit to the city in 2006. He has acknowledged that he is
well aware of "Taipei's charm" and has developed a feeling of
attachment to the northern Taiwan city.
</P>
<P>
According to Van Rensburg, his new creation draws inspiration
from his life in Taipei after he merged into the local community,
which is why he decided  to produce  and release  his first
independently composed album in Taipei. The album will be
released through Taipei-based Click Music Co.
</P>
<P>
Experimental music is considered an extension of traditional
music, often adding unconventional instruments, noises and other
novelty sounds to the compositions.
</P>
<P>
Van Rensburg's liking for experimental music appears natural, as
he admits that "anything bizarre, mystical and out of the
ordinary attracts me." He said that most of his influences come
from other arts and sensory input.
</P>
<P>
He trained on classical guitar from the age of eight and became
both a performer and composer.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 he created Supernature, an experimental rock group in
South Africa, and gained fame with a series of performances
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
He later composed and performed with the band Ohm, which had a
unique blend of rock and middle-eastern melodies, techno beats
and ambient guitar work.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 he joined one of South Africa's most well-known groups,
Battery 9. The album "Sondebok" he recorded with the group won a
South African Music Award as the best alternative rock album in
1999.
</P>
<P>
In 2004 he released a second album "Die Menere" with Battery 9's
vocalist Paul Riekert, reinventing American country music in an
Afrikaans idiom.
</P>
<P>
"Floukop," another album by him, was reviewed as a breakthrough
in Afrikaans alternative music, as well as being rated by one
critic as "one of the top 10 Americana albums of all time."
