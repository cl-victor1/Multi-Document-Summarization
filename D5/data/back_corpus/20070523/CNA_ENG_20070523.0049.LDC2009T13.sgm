The Tourism Bureau will use Taiwan-born New York Yankees pitcher
Wang Chien-ming to promote the local tourism industry in a series
of TV clips to be broadcast in the United States, bureau
officials announced Wednesday.

The announcement came after the bureau accepted a proposal from
ESPN Sports Channel to sponsor 10 TV clips containing interviews
with Wang and featuring Taiwan's tourist attractions.

The clips are scheduled to be broadcast first in Taiwan May 29
and then in the U.S. June 9, Tourism Bureau Director-General
Janice Lai said.

Around 92.28 million households in the U.S. are expected to watch
the clips, according to Lai.

Describing the NT$10 million (US$298,864) project as worthwhile,
Lai noted that the bureau is endeavoring to explore overseas
sales channels for Taiwan's tourism.

The bureau will continue to ask Taiwanese celebrities to serve as
spokesmen in TV commercials promoting Taiwan, she said.
