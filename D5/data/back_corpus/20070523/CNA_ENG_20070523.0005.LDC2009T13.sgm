KMT, BUSINESSMEN THREATS TO TAIWAN-U.S.-CHINA TIES: EX-U.S.
OFFICIAL

Taipei,   May  22  (CNA) 05/23/07  10:10:09 (By Chris Wang)

<P>
Taiwanese businessmen and the main opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT)
are  among "four  threats"  to Taiwan-U.S.-China relations, an
ex-U.S. official said in a forum Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China, the international community and
the U.S.'s use of the phrase "one China, " Taiwanese businessmen
and the KMT are four threats to Taiwan-U.S.-China relations,
according to Bruce Herschensohn, a political commentator who
served as deputy special assistant to disgraced former President
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
Herschensohn also suggested when he met President Chen Shui-bian
Tuesday that Oct. 25 should be a national holiday "celebrating
Taiwan's independence" because Taiwan gave up its seat in the
United Nations Oct. 25, 1971.
</P>
<P>
With so much trade being done with China, it seems the majority
of Taiwanese businessmen lean toward maintaining the status quo,
he pointed out, adding that people are reluctant to discuss
Taiwan independence due to the fear of going to war.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is at risk for not being independent, " he claimed,
saying that Taiwan has to depend on outside help and that
businessmen cannot keep their businesses from potential risk.
</P>
<P>
As for the KMT, he said that from listening to KMT presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou and other KMT politicians, "you can always
feel China in the background." An even more confusing fact is
that the KMT  did  not  participate in a rally  against  China's
"anti-secession law" rally in March 2005, while less than a week
later, KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan visited China.
</P>
<P>
China is obviously a threat, but being moderate to a country that
deploys more than 900 missiles against Taiwan is even more
dangerous thinking,  Herschensohn added while questioned "some
people's" attitudes toward China.
</P>
<P>
He also said he does not oppose the "one China" phrase but "at
the same time, there's also one Taiwan and one Australia" and
Taiwan has never been under the control of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
Herschensohn said that since Taiwan will not be recognized in the
U.N. after so many failed bids, it might as well "take the
opposite course" and do what it thinks is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
Herschensohn,  Pepperdine University Vice Chancellor Michael
Wardner and senior advisor to President Chen Shui-bian Wu Li-pei
were the three major participants in a forum titled "U.S.-Taiwan
Relations Retrospective and Prospects" organized by the pro-
independence Taiwan Thinktank.
