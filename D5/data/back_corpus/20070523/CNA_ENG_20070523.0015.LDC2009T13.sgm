<P>
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung warned Wednesday that Taiwan's 2007
economic growth rate could slide by 0.45 percent if the general
budget bill remains shelved at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chang expressed  concern  at the Executive  Yuan over the
legislature's failure to pass the 2007 budget bill, while
encouraging his Cabinet to try their utmost to fulfill the goal
of achieving economic growth of 4.6 percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
The new premier told his Cabinet members that Taiwan needs to be
more aggressive in working to boost domestic consumer demand
while striving to expand exports amid a slowdown in global
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who served as premier between 2000 and 2002, was named
premier again May 14 to replace Su, who resigned after being
defeated in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
primary for the presidential election. He took office Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the Executive Yuan, Chang instructed relevant government units
to accelerate efforts to implement special budget programs that
have yet to be initiated, including several major national
construction projects and flood control projects; to encourage
the private sector to invest in public construction; to promote
tourism development; to push for renovation of old residential
units; and to make sure that more than 90 percent of planned
public construction projects are carried out.
