DPP CHINA EXPERT URGES MORE CONSTRUCTIVE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARD
TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  21:35:46 (By Chris Wang)

A ruling party Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) China expert
said Tuesday that the United States has been sending Taiwan mixed
signals in its cross-Taiwan Strait policy during the past few
years and urged the U.S. to take a "more constructive attitude"
toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. policy and attitude has been playing an important role
in Taiwan-U.S.-China relations, which is why Taiwan needs to
clearly understand and grasp the messages the U.S. sends out,
said Lai I-chung, director of the DPP's Department of Chinese
Affairs, in a forum.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is frustrated with Taiwan for not being able to complete
the arms procurement approved by U.S. president George W. Bush in
2001. At the same time, however, it has said that the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) leaders' visits to China have been
"helpful in reducing cross-strait tension, " Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Young, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Taipei office, also asked Taiwan to be more economically open to
China during a meeting with President Chen Shui-bian a week
earlier, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time U.S. official had linked the Taiwan-U.S.
free trade agreement with the three links, " Lai said, adding
that the remark might be counter to the "six assurances"
submitted by the Reagan Administration in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan was encouraged at that time to open up more economically
to China, although Taiwan placed more than 70 percent of its
foreign direct investment (FDI) in China and 40 percent of its
exports went to China. However, the items listed by the U.S. in
the ongoing U.S.-China Economic Strategic Dialogue are all about
addressing U.S. concern of China's currency policy, non-
transparent financial practices and numerous trade violations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, that is a contradiction, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the improving Taiwan-Japan relationship, Lai also said the
U.S. should allow Taiwan's minister-level officials to meet their
U.S. counterparts instead of staff-level officials, one of the
implications  that was interpreted  by some observers  as why
Taiwan-U.S. relationship has been deteriorating in recent years.

Bruce Herschensohn a former deputy special assistant to disgraced
former U.S. President Richard Nixon, Pepperdine University Vice
Chancellor Michael Wardner and senior advisor to President Chen
Shui-bian Wu Li-pei were the three major participants in a forum
titled "U.S.-Taiwan Relations Retrospective and Prospects"
organized by the pro-independence Taiwan Thinktank.
