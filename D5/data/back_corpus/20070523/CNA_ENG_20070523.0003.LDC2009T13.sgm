NAME-CHANGE BATTLE `UNPRODUCTIVE': PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/23/07  10:01:10 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The presidential nominee of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Tuesday described the name-change battle between the
central government and the Taipei city government as unproductive
and unwanted by the people.
</P>
<P>
Frank Hsieh, who served as premier from February 2005 to January
2006, made the remarks after Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, a member
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , renamed the plaza in front
of the Presidential Office "Anti-Corruption Square" in a move to
counter the central government's decision to rename the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said politicians should spend more time thinking about how
to help the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
"The central and local governments should work together instead
of fighting each other," he said, adding that the endless
conflict is only harming the people.
</P>
<P>
Also commenting on the name-change battle, Ma Ying-jeou, the
presidential nominee of the KMT, noted that the mayor did not
change the name of Ketagalan Boulevard but only added a
"supplementary name" in parentheses to let people know that the
road section in front of the Presidential Office can also be
called "Anti-Corruption Square."
</P>
<P>
Ma said Hsieh should have blamed the central government for
initiating the name- change battle through a series of steps to
rename Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and state-owned
enterprises, including China Shipbuilding Corp., Chinese
Petroleum Corp. and Chunghwa Post Co., as well as the Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
Ma said he is not opposed to any name change, provided the
central government does it through the legal process.
</P>
<P>
The DPP-led government has insisted on renaming the Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall because it sees the late president as a
dictator and the person responsible for ordering a brutal
crackdown that resulted in the deaths of some 30,000 people
following the 228 Incident of 1947.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei city government used the "Anti-Corruption Square"
moniker in an apparent attempt to humiliate President Chen Shui-
bian, who has been named as a joint perpetrator along with his
wife in an embezzlement case involving the alleged misuse of his
"special state affairs fund" set aside for the president's use.
