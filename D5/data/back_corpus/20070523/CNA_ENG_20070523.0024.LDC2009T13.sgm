PRESIDENT SEEKS FEEDBACK ON INDEPENDENCE DAY PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 23 (CNA) 05/23/07  17:29:27 (By Elizabeth Hsu)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday asked representatives of a
U.S. private think tank for their opinion on a proposal to
designate Oct. 25 as "Taiwan independence Day".
</P>
<P>
Chen made the request in a meeting with the representatives of
the Washington D.C.-based National Committee on American Foreign
Policy at his office.
</P>
<P>
The  proposal  was put forward  the day before  by Bruce
Herschensohn, a professor of public policy at Pepperdine
University in California, during his meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
The president told the representatives that the issue is "serious
and sensitive, requiring discussions in a very cautious and
careful manner."
</P>
<P>
In his meeting Tuesday, Herschensohn further proposed that Taiwan
stop its bid to join the United Nations to avoid gathering in the
same hall with representatives of "infamous governments."
</P>
<P>
Herschensohn, the author of the book "Taiwan: The Threatened
Democracy, " suggested that Taiwan's government change its way of
thinking,  proposing  that while most American  people display
dissatisfaction with the U.N.'s performance, Taiwan could just
declare that it "does not want to join meetings with murderers,
kidnappers and terrorists." He further suggested that the
government designate the date that saw Taiwan withdraw from the
U.N. as Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he believes what Herschensohn really means is that the
U.N. is not an organization deserving of Taiwan's participation.
However, the president added, the scholar thinks that "Taiwan
must manifest the fact that it is a sovereign, independent
country."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the issue is a solemn one, Chen said he looks forward
to listening to his guests' opinions. All the visiting U.S.
scholars said they are willing to present their views, but in
private.
