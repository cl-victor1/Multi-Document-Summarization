TAIWAN

Taipei,  May  23 (CNA) 05/23/07  12:48:21 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has recently launched an international
publicity campaign through media interviews and video conferences
in what is an alternative diplomacy to break through China's
isolation of Taiwan in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, China has continued to block Taiwan's
efforts to take part in international organizations and sabotage
the president's overseas visits by intervening in his visa
applications and transit plans, despite the goodwill gestures
that Taiwan has extended to China, officials close to Chen
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to pierce through China's diplomatic suppression
against  Taiwan, Chen has since late April led an intensive
international  publicity drive targeting Europe,  Asia and the
Americas, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Chen has held video conferences with politicians,
academics and media in Berlin and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
As Germany is the rotating chair of the European Union for this
year, the president hopes the German government will exert its
influence and support the continuation of the E.U. arms embargo
against China before China democratizes its political system and
improves its human rights record, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva video conference focused on Taiwan's bid to become a
full member of the World Health Organization. Chen stressed
during the event that Taiwan is a sovereign state entitled to WHO
membership and that the country's application should be
considered by all WHO members, rather than being subject to
unilateral judgment by the WHO Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Chen was interviewed by the Bloomberg
financial news service, and he is scheduled to hold a video
conference May 29 with international media based in Washington
D.C.
</P>
<P>
The event is being organized by the Washington-based National
Press Club, with Chen invited as a newsmaker to discuss the theme
of "Democratic Taiwan: Challenges and Perspectives."
</P>
<P>
In Asia,  the  president  was  interviewed  on TV by the
Singapore-based Channel News Asia, in light of Singapore's great
influence in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted in the interview that ASEAN is Taiwan's fourth largest
trade partner, with trade between the two sides surpassing US$50
billion for 2006 and Taiwan investment in the region totalling
approximately US$50 billion.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Taiwan has been ignored, marginalized and even
ostracized in regional economic integration efforts because of
China's obstruction,  Chen expressed the hope that Taiwan can
establish free trade agreements with ASEAN countries.
