Prosecutors are set to subpoena several former National Palace
Museum officials Wednesday over a suspected profiteering scandal
involving a museum facelift project.
</P>
<P>
The interrogation of the museum's two former chief secretaries,
Hsueh Fei-yuan and Liu Chang-hsin, will come a day after local
prosecutors led more than 60 investigators in searching their
offices and residences for evidence of suspected irregularities.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's massive raid,  the offices and residences of
architect Luo Hsing- hua and other contractors were also
searched.
</P>
<P>
A large collection of files and documents, including the texts of
a contract between the museum and Luo's company and blueprints
for the museum's face-lift projects, were seized in the raid.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution authorities said the raid was launched only after
nearly two years of extensive investigations. At issue was a
NT$385 million (US$11.53 million) museum renovation project that
got underway in July 2004 and was not fully completed until late
last year.
</P>
<P>
Probes got underway after law enforcement authorities received a
written petition. Investigators said they have scrutinized many
documents concerning the open tender for the renovation project,
contract negotiations, meeting minutes and selection of qualified
contractors.
</P>
<P>
Following comprehensive scrutiny, law enforcers said they found
suspected irregularities, including possible bribery taking and
favoritism. After securing search warrants, prosecutors from
Taipei's Shihlin District Prosecutor's Office led agents from the
Bureau of Investigation in raiding more than 10 locations
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, the Palace Museum renovation project
was tainted by repeated cost overruns. If necessary, they said
two former museum curators -- Tu Cheng-sheng and his successor,
Shih Shou-chien -- will be subpoenaed to clarify the decision-
making process with regard to the project. The project was
initiated during Tu's tenure. He was transferred to the post of
minister of education in 2005.
