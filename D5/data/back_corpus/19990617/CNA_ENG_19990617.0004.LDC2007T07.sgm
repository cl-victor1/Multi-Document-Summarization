Tainan,  southern  Taiwan,  June  17  (CNA) (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
An emergency control center for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was set
up Thursday by the Animal Disease Control Department under the Tainan
County Government as county officials scrambled to prevent a possible
FMD from spreading to the entire cattle population of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The move came after eight head of cattle on two Tainan County ranches
tested positive for FMD Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery came a week after 100 head of cattle on the offshore
front-line island of Kinmen were slaughtered due to FMD infection. No
cases of FMD have been reported among Taiwan's cattle population since
1929.
</P>
<P>
The Animal Disease Control Department of the Tainan County Government
on Wednesday issued an order banning the sell and transport of
livestock off the two Tainan ranches where the eight FMD-positive head
of cattle were discovered.
</P>
<P>
Samples of the suspected FMD virus were sent to an animal quarantine
center in Tanshui, Taipei County, for examination, with those results
not expected until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said, prior to Saturday all livestock from the
two Tainan ranches are barred from being transported off the ranches.
The two ranches' personnel and workers have also been temporarily
ordered not to travel.
</P>
<P>
If the Tainan cattle are confirmed to be infected with the FMD virus,
Department officials said all cattle raised on the two ranches will be
slaughtered to prevent further spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Tainan County is the largest cattle-raising region of Taiwan, with the
cattle population totaling 28,000, about one-fifth of the total cattle
on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
FMD is an acute, contagious disease that can be spread via air. It
infects mainly cloven-hoofed livestock and wild animals. Its mortality
rate is 5 percent among mature livestock and up to 50 percent among
young animals.
