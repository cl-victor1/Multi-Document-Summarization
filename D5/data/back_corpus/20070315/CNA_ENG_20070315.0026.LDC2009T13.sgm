World Vision Taiwan (WVT) has sent a team to provide aid to poor
children in India, a spokesman for the Christian charity
organization said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The team will stay in Calcutta March 13-17, World Vision Taiwan
President Tu Ming-han said, adding that the team will shoot video
footage of local children living on the streets and in ghettoes
during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The charity will show the videos in Taiwan as part of efforts to
help them understand the children's needs and to further motivate
them to lend a hand, Tu noted.
</P>
<P>
The charity has also invited a trio of famous Taiwanese singers
to serve as spokeswomen for the campaign, according to Tu.
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics conducted by the United Nations in 2006, Tu
pointed out that it is estimated that 10.5 million children
around the world die before the age of five.
</P>
<P>
Around 46 million children aged 5-17 are forced to work as child
laborers, Tu continued.
</P>
<P>
"These tragedies could have been prevented," Tu said, urging the
public to provide help.
</P>
<P>
In Calcutta alone, there are more than 5,500 ghettoes, which are
home to one- third of the city's population, according to Tu, who
added that the number of street children and child laborers is
estimated to be 100,000.
</P>
<P>
World Vision Taiwan has been helping the children by establishing
a center that offers emergency resettlement and a program of
various learning skills, Tu said.
</P>
<P>
The charity also provides medical, educational and job assistance
to underprivileged children who are unable to stay at the center,
Tu went on.
</P>
<P>
The videos will show the changes the charity has made in these
children's lives, he added.
