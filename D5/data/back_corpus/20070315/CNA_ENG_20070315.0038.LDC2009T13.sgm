President Chen Shui-bian called Thursday for an effective
military deterrent package to counter China's constant threats
against Taiwan and prevent war in the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen issued the call while presiding over a promotion and
citation ceremony of Admiral Chen Kuo-hsiang, chief of the
Political Warfare Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense.

Stressing the importance of building up the military's morale and
upgrading its defensive capabilities at a time when the cross-
strait situation is becoming increasingly risky, Chen said that
the military must be fully trained and prepared to counter
China's growing offensive on the media, psychological and legal
fronts.
</P>
<P>
Under Taiwan's past authoritarian rule, the military used to
serve only a certain political party or certain individuals, but
in the present days since the power transfer of 2000, the
military must remain free from political influence and maintain
neutrality in compliance with its constitutional role, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China has never stopped its relentless efforts to swallow up
Taiwan and is increasing its military spending at a rapid pace,
with an annual growth rate of 20.4 percent for last year -- the
largest rise in 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president encouraged all of Taiwan's military personnel to
realize their responsibilities as stipulated in the Constitution
and strictly follow their constitutional requirements to make
themselves an "iron force,"  strong enough to deter or fend off
war across the strait.
