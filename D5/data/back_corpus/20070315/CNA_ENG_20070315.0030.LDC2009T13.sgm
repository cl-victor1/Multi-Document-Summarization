The Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
inaugurated Thursday a new laboratory for flexible electronics
development that will serve both as a platform for international
cooperation and a springboard for local industry, ITRI officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the necessity of the lab, the officials said advanced
flexible electronics-related technology is key to the next-
generation development in the information technology industry.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the institute has already re-allocated resources
to this area and has also achieved some breakthroughs, including
a micro-array ultrasonic transducer and a flexible electronic
memo.
</P>
<P>
The micro-array ultrasonic transducer can reduce the use of gel
and streamline the procedure required, they said, adding that
once the patient puts on the coat-like device, the doctor can
then receive visual input of the organs.

<P>
As for the flexible electronic memo, they said, the device --
made specifically for schoolchildren -- offers a voice recording
capacity of up to eight minutes that can be used as an assignment
reminder, as well as a flexible display that can be used by
teachers and parents for audiovisual communications.
