A two-year television digitization project was launched Thursday,
aimed at piloting Taiwan's high-definition satellite
transmissions in 2008 and transforming all the country's
television transmission systems into high- definition TV (HDTV)
by 2010.

Addressing a ceremony to mark the launch of the HDTV project,
Government Information Office head Cheng Wen-tsang envisaged that
by 2010,  when all Taiwan's television  transmission  systems are
digitized, or converted to HDTV, the five terrestrial TV channels
will be operating 30 digital channels, greatly improving their
services to the Taiwan audience.

Officials from the Public Television Service (PTS) , the core
sponsor of the HDTV project, said tests of HD transmissions via
satellite are expected to begin before 2008 so that viewers will
be able to watch live HDTV transmissions of the 2008 Beijing
Olympic Games.

It is expected that one year after the HDTV launch, about 300,000
Taiwan households will have become subscribers to the service,
generating business revenue worth around NT$15 billion (US$460
million), PTS officials said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also expressed hope that after 2010, when all Taiwan's
television transmissions are HDTV, more diverse educational TV
programs will be produced in Taiwan to allow viewers access to
better viewing than just news channels or political talk shows.
