The Bureau of Energy will sponsor an energy conservation contest
to promote efficient use of energy, a bureau official said
Thursday.

According to the bureau's plan, 15 energy-efficient enterprises
or institutions will be selected for public recognition in July.
</P>
<P>
Prospective applicants are welcome to register for the contest
now through March 31, the official said.

Businesses or groups from both the public and private sector are
invited to take part in the contest by submitting applications or
through  recommendations  from related  agencies,  associations,
governments, the Industrial Technology Research Institute or
Taiwan Green Productivity Foundation, according to the official.

The selection will cover two categories -- manufacturing and non-
manufacturing industries  --  and will take into  account
industry-specific characteristics, the amount of energy
consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

A panel of judges consisting of energy saving experts and
scholars is scheduled to choose the 15 enterprises best achieving
sound performance in energy conservation after primary, secondary
and final evaluation stages, the official noted, adding that the
winners will each be awarded NT$ 300,000 (US$9,230) at a citation
ceremony slated for July.
