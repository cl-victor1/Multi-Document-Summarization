Two ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
aspirants said Thursday they would not oppose the inclusion of
Taiwan into the relay of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Torch so long
as Taiwan's national sovereignty and dignity will not be
undermined or compromised.
</P>
<P>
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh, both of
who have thrown their hat in the ring for the DPP primary for the
2008 presidential election, made the remarks after a local
newspaper reported the same day that the Beijing Olympic Torch is
very likely relayed through Taiwan.

Noting that the Olympic Torch has traditionally been relayed
through major countries around the world before it reaches the
host country shortly before the opening day of the Olympic Games,
Yu said if Taiwan is not regarded as a local government in the
event, he will welcome the inclusion of the Taiwan leg in the
Beijing Olympic Torch relay. Otherwise, Yu said he couldn't
support the arrival of the torch.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh echoed Yu's views, saying that he would throw his support
behind the arrival of the Beijing Olympic Torch provided that
Taiwan's national status and dignity remain intact in the relay.
