Coast guard patrol ships launched a crackdown Thursday on
intruding Chinese fishing boats in waters off the Penghu island
group.

<P>
The crackdown  was part of a campaign  initiated  by the Cabinet-
level Coast Guard Administration to prevent poaching of Chinese
fishing boats in Taiwan's territorial waters and better protect
Taiwan's fishery resources and local fishermen's legitimate
rights and interests, Penghu coast guard officials said.

<P>
From 8 a.m. through 4 p.m., coast guard patrol ships collaborated
with an airborne squad in dispersing Chinese fishing boats
illegally operating in waters west of Penghu's Kupoyu islet and
areas south of Hsichiyu and waters west of Chimei islet. Thanks
to joint air-maritime operations, the officials said, nine
Chinese fishing vessels were chased out of those regions.
