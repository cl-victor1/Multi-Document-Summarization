KMT WILLING TO CONTACT CHINA FOR REBAR FOUNDER'S REPATRIATION

Taipei,  Jan.  11 (CNA) 01/11/07  18:05:43 (By Deborah Kuo)

Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday
that the party will work toward having the founder of financially
troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group repatriated from China to be
brought to justice in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the KMT has already revoked the party membership of Rebar
group founder Wang You-theng, and that the KMT's Central Standing
Committee will meet soon to discuss whether the party should
expel Wang once and for all in the wake of the Rebar financial
flop, which has triggered a financial storm in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the KMT would be willing to help make contact via certain
channels with Chinese authorities for Wang's repatriation, but he
noted it is the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's
responsibility to oversee the financial condition of The Chinese
Bank -- one of the subsidiary operations of the financially
distressed Rebar group -- in advance, and to defuse the crisis
afterward.
</P>
<P>
It makes no sense if the ruling DPP lays the blame for the Rebar
financial crisis on the KMT, Ma argued.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, two DPP officials asked Ma to negotiate with
China to have Wang repatriated. Wang reportedly fled to China
with his fourth wife, shortly before prosecutors prohibited the
Wangs and some 40 other family members and senior executives of
the Rebar group from leaving the country, pending an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The DPP officials accused the KMT of maintaining close links with
many of Taiwan's economic criminals who have fled to China to
escape prosecution, dating back to when it was Taiwan's ruling
party -- before 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rebar headquarters and other subsidiary offices were
searched and key evidence seized that was unfavorable to those
who stand accused in the Rebar scandals, prompting a Taipei
Prosecutor's Office ruling Thursday in which 47 Rebar group
executives and Wang family members are now prohibited from
leaving Taiwan -- an increase from 43 a day before. The charges
include breach of trust, forgery, fraud,  insider trading,
embezzlement  of corporate funds and violations of the banking
law and accounting regulations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the prosecutors ruled that Wang Ling-yi, one of
Wang's sons and the president of Chia Hsin Food &amp; Synthetic
Fiber Co. -- a Rebar subsidiary -- and Wang Shih-chan, Wang's
younger brother and president of Union Insurance Co. -- another
Rebar affiliate -- were to be taken into custody the same day and
held incommunicado on grounds they might collude and attempt to
destroy evidence.
</P>
<P>
Two Rebar Group subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin
Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for insolvency
reorganization last Thursday, which prompted a run on The Chinese
Bank, another Rebar affiliate.
