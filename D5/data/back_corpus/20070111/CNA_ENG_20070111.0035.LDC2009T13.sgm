The Vatican is not expected to touch on issues concerning the
establishment of diplomatic relations with China during its
upcoming China policy meeting, an official of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yi-min, director-general of the MOFA's Department of European
Affairs, made the remarks in response to a report by the South
China Morning Post that the Vatican will call a meeting in mid-
January to discuss the Holy See's China policy, including the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the conference will be presided over by
the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Tarciscio Bertone, and
Cardinal Zen Ze-kiun of the Hong Kong diocese will also attend
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a routine news conference, Liu said as far as he
knows, the meeting will be aimed at discussing various problems
arising from the illegitimate appointments of new bishops by
Beijing authorities in 2006, regardless of the Holy See's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan has been maintaining smooth communications
with the Vatican, Liu said that Holy See officials will deliver a
briefing on conclusions reached at the upcoming meeting to their
Taiwanese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
China and the Vatican have been maintaining contacts over the
past years. Beijing has put forth several conditions on the
establishment of diplomatic links with the Holy See, including
the demand that it must not interfere with China's "internal
affairs" and must sever diplomatic relations with Taiwan. But the
matter has been at a standstill since the Vatican refused to
compromise on some of these conditions.
