Less than 50 percent of college and university students have
opted to work immediately after graduation, according to the
results of a survey released Wednesday by the Ministry of
Education.

The survey was conducted in May 2006 on 134,120 college and
university students who were set to graduate that year and 16,000
graduates who graduated in 2005.

Among those who were set to graduate in 2006, 46 percent were
prepared to work, 34 percent were prepared to further their
studies and 17 percent were prepared to perform their military
service after graduation, according to the survey.

While 56 percent of students from private science and technology
universities were prepared to work, one-fifth of public
university students were prepared to further their studies, 24
percent of which were planning to study overseas.

Meanwhile, 64 percent of public college students and 52 percent
of private college students were planning to further their
studies.

The survey found that 78 percent of the students were satisfied
with the disciplines they had chosen, with the highest degree of
satisfaction  seen among students in the fields of industrial
technology,  domestic  science,  medicine and  health,  law,
transportation, communications and art.

Among the graduates who graduated in 2005, 41 percent were
working, 27 percent were studying and 8.5 percent were looking
for jobs, according to the survey.

domestic science, business and management as well as medicine and
health registered the highest employment rates -- at 55 percent
to 65 percent, 65 percent of graduates trained in the field of
natural science were pursuing further studies.

the working graduates were unrelated to their training.
