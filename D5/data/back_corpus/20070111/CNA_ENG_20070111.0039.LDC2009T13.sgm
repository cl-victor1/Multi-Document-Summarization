The quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) will step up the number of trade exhibitions it attends
in China to retain its market share, a TAITRA spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, Taiwan remained the
country's third- largest import source after Japan and South
Korea during the first three quarters of 2006, but Taiwan's
market share in China has since slumped to 11 percent, the TAITRA
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen Taiwan's export advantage, TAITRA will increase its
participation in China exhibitions, targeting larger-scale
industries such as mechanical, electronics, and vehicle
components, as well as extending the locations of exhibitions in
which it has a presence to Chengdu, Changchen and Shengyang.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Japan and South Korea's stable market shares, and
Thailand's expanding export to China, Taiwan's competition
advantage in that market has downgraded, the spokesman said.
China's imports from Thailand registered an amazing 28.7 percent
growth during the period.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the country's export advantage, TAITRA has come up
with a "move north, go west" that will see it participate in
shows such as the Xiamen Machinery and Electronics Exhibition,
the Dalian Import and Export Commodities Fair, and the Western
China International Economy and Trade Fair in Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, TAITRA hopes to help Taiwanese
businessmen expand their PRC market share and to strive for the
maximum exhibition benefit through the exhibition  strategy of
combining industry attributes with local color.
