MAC CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT COLLABORATION IN FIGHTING CRIME
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 10 (CNA) 01/11/07  10:31:10 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should sit down to discuss the
crafting of a joint crime-fighting mechanism for mutual benefit,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wu's call came amid judicial investigations into suspected
irregularities involving troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group, whose
founder Wang You-theng fled to China with his wife shortly before
prosecutors prohibited the Wangs and some 40 other family members
and senior executives of the group from leaving the country
pending investigation.
</P>
<P>
As judicial authorities are still probing the case, Wu said he is
not in a position to issue a public statement on this specific
case.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted, however, that as many of Taiwan's most wanted economic
criminals -- including Tuntex Group Chairman Chen You-hao -- have
taken shelter in China, Taiwan people are prone to perceive China
as a haven for Taiwanese economic fugitives.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Chinese law enforcement authorities and other relevant
organizations should negotiate with Taiwan on how to collaborate
closely to combat crime.
</P>
<P>
"We need an institutionalized cross-strait cooperative mechanism
to avert criminal activities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Two Rebar Group subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin
Food &amp; Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for bankruptcy protection
last Thursday and prompted a run on The Chinese Bank, another
Rebar affiliate.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities raided the group's headquarters and the
offices of its subsidiaries  Wednesday in probes into alleged
irregularities involving the group, including breach of trust,
forgery, fraud, insider trading, embezzlement of corporate fund
and violations of the banking law and accounting regulations.
