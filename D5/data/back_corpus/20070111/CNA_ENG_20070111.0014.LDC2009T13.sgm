DPP WANTS KMT HEAD TO ASK CHINA TO SEND BACK ECONOMIC CRIMINALS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   Jan.  11  (CNA) 01/11/07  14:25:09 (By Flor Wang)

Officials of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Thursday
to help push China to repatriate Taiwan's economic criminals to
serve justice.
</P>
<P>
DPP public relations department head Mung I-chao and China
affairs department director Lai I-chung issued the call at the
DPP headquarters after a run broke out on the Chinese Bank, an
operation unit of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, last Friday --
something which experts are worried could lead to a series of
chain reactions in Taiwan's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Mung and Lai asked Ma negotiate with China and ask relevant
Chinese authorities to send back Taiwan's economic criminals
hiding out there on the grounds that many of the criminals have
long maintained close links with the KMT dating back to when it
was Taiwan's ruling party before 2000.
</P>
<P>
Both men said that they cannot  agree with Ma's attitude
concerning the Chinese Bank run, arguing that the KMT chairman
did not even make any comment regarding the issue during the
party's Central Standing Committee (CSC) weekly meeting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rebar Chairman Wang You-theng, who used to be a member of the
KMT's decision- making CSC, had reportedly fled to China with his
wife after two Rebar subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection
last Thursday, prompting a run on the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mung also claimed that many former ranking officials in the
previous KMT government had committed crimes in Taiwan and had
fled to China. He criticized Ma for failing to engage in self-
reflection in this regard and argued that the KMT chief must take
the initiative to demand that China repatriate Taiwan's economic
criminals.
