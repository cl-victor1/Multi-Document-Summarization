Taiwan is willing to join forces with other democratic countries
to help promote China's democratization, the top official in
charge of Taiwan's China policy said during a meeting Thursday
with parliamentarians from Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
China's adherence to totalitarianism and its reluctance to
promote democracy and freedom is the major factor why a majority
of the Taiwan people cannot accept eventual unification with
China or the "one country, two system" formula put forward by the
Beijing authorities, Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu told his guests.
</P>
<P>
Describing democracy as an irresistible international trend, Wu
forecast that with China's economic rise, call from its citizens
for democratization will get stronger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
Future relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will
hinge on China's internal evolution, Wu went on, adding that if
China can become democratic, it would help improve cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.
