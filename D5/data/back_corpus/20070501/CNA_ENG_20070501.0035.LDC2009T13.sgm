ANTI-TOBACCO GROUPS CALL FOR TOTAL BAN ON INDOOR SMOKING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May  1  (CNA) 05/01/07  19:38:55 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's anti-smoking groups urged the legislature Tuesday to
allow an amendment to the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act of 1997
to pass the third reading within the current legislative session,
so that smoking in indoor public areas and workplaces can be
banned altogether.
</P>
<P>
The anti-tobacco alliance consisting of 103 civic groups made the
appeal after waiting three-and-a-half months for the legislative
caucuses of the ruling and opposition parties to begin
negotiation to thrash out their differences on a few
controversial provisions.
</P>
<P>
Most provisions of the amendment passed the second reading Jan.
16, except for those providing for a total ban on smoking in
indoor public premises and workplaces, because the legislators
could not agree on the definition of "indoor public areas."
</P>
<P>
Chou Yi-heng, chief executive officer of the John Tung Foundation
-- the largest non-profit anti-smoking organization in Taiwan --
and Deng Jou-fang, founder of the Taiwan International Medical
Alliance, urged lawmakers not to block the legislation for their
own political benefits.
</P>
<P>
They called on Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to make
arrangements as soon as possible for the ruling and opposition
party caucuses to begin negotiation on an acceptable version of
the amendment.
</P>
<P>
Former award-winning actor Sun Yueh, 76, also joined the campaign
to push for the early passage of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
Sun, a smoker for 37 years, developed lung cancer in January --
23 years after he quit his four-packs-a-day habit. The first
thing he did April 18 when he recovered from surgery was to
appear in an anti-smoking television commercial.
</P>
<P>
He said that his task is still incomplete as long as there is no
total ban on smoking in indoor public places.
</P>
<P>
The anti-tobacco alliance has been calling on the legislature to
pass the amendment in time to implement a total ban on smoking in
indoor public areas no later than 2008.
</P>
<P>
Alliance workers pointed out that 20,000 people in Taiwan die of
tobacco-related causes each year, resulting in health care and
other losses amounting to NT$50 billion.
</P>
<P>
Noting that tobacco sales in Taiwan have not decreased in recent
years despite a drop in the number of adult male smokers, they
said this means that more women and youngsters have become
smokers, making it all the more urgent to ban smoking in indoor
public areas altogether.
