TAIWAN PROTESTS U.S. 'SPECIAL 301' REPORT

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  19:22:00 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The government expressed its regret and disappointment Tuesday at
the United States' decision to keep Taiwan on a watch list for
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection for the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
The government has protested the matter with the American
Institute in Taiwan, which represents the U.S. government in
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties between the two
countries, said Tsai Lien-sheng, director-general of the
Intellectual Property Office under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Pledging that Taiwan will continue to promote IPR protection,
Tsai said it is "unfair" that the United States has not removed
Taiwan from the watch list while recognizing Taiwan's "strong
efforts and significant strides in improving its IPR regime this
past year."
</P>
<P>
According to the annual "Special 301" report released Monday by
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Taiwan's
achievements in IPR protection over past year include the passage
of legislation to create a specialized IPR court, increased
numbers of raids and seizures of pirated optical media,
counterfeit pharmaceuticals and counterfeit luxury goods, and
increased arrests of IPR infringers.
</P>
<P>
However, Taiwan still needs to continue to combat counterfeiting
and Internet piracy and to pass pending IPR legislation,
specially legislation to provide liability for Internet service
providers and to address copyright piracy on peer-to-peer
networks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Taiwan is urged to take steps to improve IPR
enforcement, such as dedicating more resources to improve
enforcement against piracy on the Internet, taking enforcement
actions against the unauthorized use of copyrighted material on
or near universities, and considering stronger criminal penalties
for IPR infringement, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The annual "Special 301" report, which reviews the adequacy and
effectiveness of IPR protection by U.S. trading partners, placed
12 countries on the Priority Watch List and 30 countries on the
lower level Watch List for 2007.
</P>
<P>
After remaining on the Priority Watch List for four years, Taiwan
was lowered to the Watch List at the end of 2004.
