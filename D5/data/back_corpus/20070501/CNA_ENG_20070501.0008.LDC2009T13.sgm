Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang said Tuesday that the re-
establishment of diplomatic relations with Saint Lucia has proved
that despite China's relentless obstruction, Taiwan is a name
respected in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who is currently visiting the eastern Caribbean island
nation, made the remarks in a telephone hook-up during a news
conference convened by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
announce the resumption of bilateral diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that after more than four months of efforts, Taiwan
has been able to resume diplomatic ties with St. Lucia, showing
that despite the tremendous pressure from an emerging China,
Taiwan has been able to make new friends in the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Yang Tzu-pao said that Huang and
his St. Lucian counterpart, Rufus Bousquet, signed a joint
communique on the resumption of full diplomatic ties in the St.
Lucian capital Castries Monday night Taipei time. Taiwan
established its embassy in the country the same day.
</P>
<P>
St. Lucia has become the third country, after Kiribatis and
Nauru, with which Taiwan has established diplomatic ties since
2000 when the Democratic Progressive Party first came to power in
the country. St. Lucia also become Taiwan's 25th diplomatic ally.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that St. Lucia passed a resolution to resume
diplomatic relations with Taiwan in a Cabinet meeting April 26
during which it also commissioned the foreign minister to
coordinate with Taiwan on signing a joint communique on resuming
ties. Huang led a delegation to St. Lucia April 29 after
receiving an invitation from Bousquet.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that during the consultation process on resuming
diplomatic ties, Taiwan never once asked St. Lucia to sever its
diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has no intention of engaging in zero-sum games with China
on the diplomatic front," Huang said, noting that Taiwan hopes
for a win-win-win situation for Taiwan, St. Lucia and China.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Taiwan will provide economic assistance to St.
Lucia, Huang said that the two sides talked about cooperation
programs in the areas of agriculture,  information  education,
vocational education, handicrafts, small and medium enterprises,
medical missions, and the development of water resources.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation programs with St. Lucia are no different from
those with our other diplomatic allies," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Huang noted that Taiwan cannot compete with China in "dollar
diplomacy, " saying that Taiwan relies on its sincerity to win
friends.
</P>
<P>
St. Lucia first established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1984
but then switched diplomatic recognition to China in 1997.
