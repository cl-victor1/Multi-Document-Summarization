Anyone who has an opinion about the content of school textbooks
may send a proposal to the screening committee for their
reference, the Ministry of Education (MOE) officials said Tuesday
after two local groups demanded that textbooks include chapters
on labor rights, the history of the labor movement, and
socialism.

<P>
The National Teachers' Association  and the Labor Parents'
Federation put forward their demand at a press conference on the
eve of May 1 Labor Day.

The groups also called for the inclusion of labor and human
rights representatives on the committee that screens and reviews
textbooks.

However, according to law, only educational professionals can
serve as members of the committee, officials from the MOE and the
National Institute for Compilation and Translation responded.
