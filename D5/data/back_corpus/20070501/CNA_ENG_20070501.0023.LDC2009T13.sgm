Premier Su Tseng-chang has said that the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) needs to draft complementary
packages of measures in association with the minimum monthly wage
adjustment that has been scheduled for implementation in July.
</P>
<P>
Su made the announcement  at a commendation  ceremony for
outstanding laborers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Su said the minimum wage has to be adjusted to sustain laborers'
purchasing power and to ensure better living standard for
workers.
</P>
<P>
The Minimum Wage Review Committee under the Council of Labor
Affairs fleshed out last week a resolution on increasing the
minimum wage by between 7.5 and 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Su has not decided on the exact adjustment range of the
resolution yet, instead, he asked for complementary measures from
the CEPD and greater communication between bosses and workers on
the increase rate before the decision is rendered.
</P>
<P>
Su also said that Taiwan's employment environment is improving,
for the unemployment rate of 2006 was 3.9 percent, but fell to
3.8 percent during the first quarter of this year.
