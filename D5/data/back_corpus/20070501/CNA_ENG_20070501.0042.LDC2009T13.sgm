AMNESTY WOULD HELP RELIEVE PACKED JAILS: MOJ
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  1 (CNA) 05/01/07  21:14:06 (By T.C. Jiang)
</P>
<P>
A national commutation bill would help relieve prison
overcrowding, a Ministry of Justice (MOJ) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after media reports that prisons are so packed
that some inmates have to sleep on walkways and prison factories
are jammed.
</P>
<P>
Liao Teh-fu, director of the MOJ's Department of Corrections,
said jails are overcrowded every year and that the problem is
particularly serious this year.
</P>
<P>
Prisons in Taipei, Taoyuan, and Kaohsiung have accommodated some
inmates in prison factories in order to cope with the
overcrowding, Liao noted, a situation that has lasted for several
months already, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will begin to encourage those who can pay fines in
lieu of short sentences to pay fines instead of going to jail,
Liao said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some offenders are allowed to pay their fines in
installments and can even apply for a loan, Liao went on, adding
that this is a very effective policy that prevents even more
inmates from clogging the jail system.
</P>
<P>
Loosening restrictions on qualifications for parole and reducing
prison terms can also ease the problem of overcrowding, Liao
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Previous experience shows that the recidivism ratio of inmates
who are released after commutation is low, according to Liao.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, when the government implemented the last amnesty, the
recidivism ratio was 16.4 percent, while the ratio in the past
decade averaged between 39.8 percent and 45.1 percent.
