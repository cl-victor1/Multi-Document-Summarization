DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL: CONSENSUS-BUILDING PRIORITY FOR TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  21:35:33 (By Chris Wang)
</P>
<P>
Consensus-building is a priority for Taiwan as the current
"democratic civil war" has hindered Taiwan's national development
and democratic achievement, former Premier Frank Hsieh, one of
four ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
hopefuls, said in an interview with CNA Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, who launched his presidential campaign with the slogans of
"love and trust" and "say yes to Taiwan, " also said he believes
the people of Taiwan would be glad to see China's peaceful rise
if China holds no animosity toward it.
</P>
<P>
In another effort to explain his controversial "One China"
framework for the Constitution, which has been under criticism by
hardcore Taiwan independence supporters, Hsieh reiterated that he
foresees an eventual "one Taiwan" constitution and that when he
said "China" he was referring to the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"The percentage of people who recognize `Taiwan identity' has
been constantly over 70 percent in most public opinion polls. The
DPP, however, has been able to win only around 50 percent of the
vote in elections, " Hsieh said, noting that the 20 percent-30
percent differential is something the ruling party should think
about.
</P>
<P>
The number shows that people who recognize "Taiwan identity" do
not  necessarily support  the  DPP's  policies.  Hsieh  said
consensus-building will be his priority if he wins his bid to be
the DPP presidential candidate and wins the 2008 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, we will have a new constitution that reflects
Taiwan's status quo: an independent country, " Hsieh said.
</P>
<P>
The former premier once again elaborated on his initiative of a
"national stability alliance" and a "coalition government,"
saying that it will be his responsibility, if he wins the
election, to help the DPP control the majority in the
legislature" so that we can be held accountable for our policies
and so that the people will not suffer."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the recent controversy over the 2008 Beijing Olympic
torch relay route, Hsieh noted that he supported the government's
decision to reject Beijing's torch rely plan but had second
thoughts about a potential boycott of the 2008 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
A national leader is expected to find a "holistic solution"
instead of making decisions on the concept of "either/or, " Hsieh
said, adding that the suppression by China of Taiwan's
international participation is almost a given. He said he will
try to find a way for Taiwan to participate in international
affairs and events without interference from China.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he believes Taiwan is an ocean state and that this
concept will be dominant in his national development plan. He
also advocated bidding to host the 2020 Olympics and of a more
liberal economic system.
</P>
<P>
The DPP will by May 12 at the earliest determine its candidate
for the 2008 presidential election. The presidential primary's
public opinion poll will take place from May 9-11 and will
account for 70 percent of the score in determining who will
represent the party, with the other 30 percent accounted through
a vote by party members May 6.
</P>
<P>
The other three aspirants are Vice President Annette Lu, Premier
Su Tseng-chang and former DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.
