'MA EXCLUSION BILL' EXCLUDED FROM PROCEDURE COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  19:40:18 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
A draft bill targeting former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was excluded Tuesday for the third
time from the agenda of the legislative Procedure Committee.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Yih-jiau Huang, a lawmaker of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) who also serves as executive director of the party's
central policy center, attributed the latest development to PFP
Chairman James Soong's directive asking party lawmakers to help
their KMT peers prevent the bill from appearing on the
committee's agenda and thus from been referred to the standing
committee for substantial screening.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the KMT has displayed its sincerity, there is no reason
for the PFP to remain skeptical of its good faith, " Huang quoted
Soong as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soong decided to stand with the KMT after PFP lawmaker Li Fudien
was assured by KMT Secretary-General Wu Duen-yih the previous
night that a seven-point pledge on cooperation in December's
legislative election remains valid, said a ranking PFP official
who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the PFP official said Li and Wu forged an additional
agreement on KMT-PFP cooperation in the coming legislative polls.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the proposed amendment to the Presidential and
Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law drafted by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Part has helped lay the foundation for the
KMT and PFP to avoid a split in the next legislative and
presidential elections, thereby bringing the pan-blue camp a
greater chance of victory.
