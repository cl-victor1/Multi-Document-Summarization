BASIC MINIMUM WAGE WILL BE RAISED JULY 1: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  18:47:57 (By Luis Huang)
</P>
<P>
The basic minimum wage will be raised July 1 as scheduled,
Premier Su Tseng- chang said Tuesday at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Su made the remarks while fielding questions from opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Yang Li-huan during a question session.
Yang questioned whether Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman
Lee Ying-yuan's resignation was because the Cabinet had put a
hold on CLA plans to raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
In response, Su said a screening committee under the Executive
Yuan had given the green light to a CLA-proposed raise in the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
According to Su, the CLA didn't submit its proposed raise range
for the minimum wage to the Executive Yuan until the previous
day. The premier also said he has asked Lee to continue to serve
in his post because many subsequent administrative procedures
concerning the minimum wage hike remain to be handled.
</P>
<P>
Lee announced at a news conference called earlier in the day his
decision to resign from his post because of the Cabinet's
decision the day before not to announce a CLA adjustment plan May
1.
</P>
<P>
The nation's current minimum wage stands at NT$15,840 (US$476)
per month or NT$66 per hour, which has not been adjusted for a
decade. The CLA proposed raising the minimum wage by between 7.5
percent and 9.5 percent beginning July 1.
</P>
<P>
However, during a meeting with leaders of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Monday night, the premier insisted that the
plan should be shelved for the time being on the grounds that it
may trigger accusations by the other DPP presidential hopefuls
that he is engaging in pork barrel politics to woo voters in the
presidential primary.
