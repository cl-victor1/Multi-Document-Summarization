PRESIDENT URGES BEIJING TO ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE WITH TAIWAN'S GOV'T
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 1 (CNA) 05/01/07  14:11:09 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has again urged the Chinese leadership
to engage in direct dialogue and consultations with his
administration for the sake of improving relations across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call late Monday while addressing a ceremony in the
central city of Taichung to mark the third anniversary of a
private association promoting cooperation among the agricultural,
industrial and academic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a just-concluded economic and cultural forum in
Beijing between Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
Communist Party of China (CPC), Chen said that without the
support of his democratically elected government, no agreements
or conclusions reached at such meetings can take effect.
</P>
<P>
Chen also warned that Beijing's insistence on engaging Taiwan's
opposition party while ignoring its legally elected government
will have a negative effect on cross-strait relations and make it
difficult for Beijing to win the Taiwan people's hearts and
souls.
</P>
<P>
For mutual benefits, Chen said the Chinese leaders should engage
in direct dialogue and consultations with Taiwan's popularly
elected government as soon as possible to address many stalled
market opening and bilateral cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Chen continued, the KMT and the CPC
repeatedly pledged at their annual forum to help Taiwanese
farmers export their produce to the Chinese market. However, Chen
said, these "sugar-coated promises" have turned out to be empty
words or even a nightmare,  with Chinese farmers stealing
Taiwan's agricultural know-how and selling counterfeit Taiwan
brand-named agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Without his administration's strong warnings and precautionary
measures, Chen said he believes that Taiwan farmers would have
suffered even more serious losses.
</P>
<P>
Chen also lambasted  KMT Honorary Chairman  Lien Chan for
collaborating with China in attempting to debase his
administration.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has consistently spared no efforts to suppress
Taiwan diplomatically with the aim of undermining Taiwan's
sovereign status and forcing Taiwan to accept its unification
terms, Chen said he believes that the KMT and Lien himself are
fully aware of China's "tricks and ill intentions."
</P>
<P>
"However, they are still willing to sing a duet with the Chinese
communists to belittle our government and insult our national
dignity. While adopting a China- leaning policy line, the KMT and
Lien are pursuing their partisan and personal political interests
at the expense of Taiwan's national interests," Chen lamented.
