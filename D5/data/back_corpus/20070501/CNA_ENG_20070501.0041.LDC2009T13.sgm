Liver function abnormalities are most commonly discovered among
white-collar men aged between 41 and 50 in Taiwan, according to
the results of a survey released Tuesday by a local health
institution.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Lianan Wellness Center, was based on
the records of 13,188 men and 11,312 women who received liver
function tests at the center in 2006.
</P>
<P>
It was found that 43.3 of the test recipients had fatty liver,
17.2 percent displayed abnormalities in their GPT liver enzyme
level and 4.5 percent showed abnormalities in their GOT liver
enzyme level.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of fatty liver was the highest among men in the 41-50
age group and the 51-60 age group, with 38 percent of those in
the groups having the problem, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Among women, the highest ratio of fatty liver was in the 61-70
age group, with 25 percent of those in the group having the
problem.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the GPT level, 17.6 percent of men aged 41 to 50
showed abnormalities, compared with 16.4 percent of those aged 31
to 40.
</P>
<P>
Among women, the ratio of abnormalities in the GPT level tended
to increase after 50 years old, with 5 percent of recipients in
the 51-60 age group and the 61-70 age group displaying
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the GOT level, abnormalities were seen to appear in
people over 30 years old, both men and women alike, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Fang Sheng-wei, director of the center, urged office workers to
develop healthy living habits, noting that liver abnormalities
among that group are related to lack of sleep, too much overtime,
smoking, drinking and lack of exercise.
