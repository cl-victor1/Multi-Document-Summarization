Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  19:21:38 (By Luis Huang)

Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei
said Tuesday that his party will ask the Council of Grand
Justices to give a constitutional interpretation of the question
of whether the Legislative Yuan's delay in approving the central
government's 2007 budget plan has violated the Constitution.

"Lawmakers have the right to review and cut the budget, but they
have no right to delay or refuse to review it, " Huang said
during an interview  with reporters  after  meeting  with Control
Yuan Secretary-General Fan Kuang-chun.

<P>
Huang said the Legislative Yuan's delay in approving the budget
plan has not only impacted the people's welfare but has also
triggered a constitutional crisis.

Meanwhile, Chiang Yueh-chin, executive director of the TSU's
publicity department, said the party has commissioned lawyers to
study a constitutional interpretation proposal, adding that
should Premier Chang Chun-hsiung fail to resolve the budget issue
within this week, the proposal will be formally submitted next
week.
</P>
<P>
Under the Budget Law, the Executive Yuan's budget plan for 2007
should have cleared the legislature Nov. 31, 2006. However, it
has been delayed for nearly six months due to incessant partisan
bickering over an opposition Kuomintang- drafted amendment bill
on the organization of the Central Election Commission (CEC) ,
under which CEC members would be recommended by political parties
in proportion to the number of seats they hold in the
legislature. The ruling DPP opposes the notion.
