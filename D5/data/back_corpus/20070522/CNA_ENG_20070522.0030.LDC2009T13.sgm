DPP LAWMAKERS RESERVED ABOUT ESTABLISHING `THIRD SOCIALIST PARTY'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May  22  (CNA) 05/22/07  19:32:15 (By Han Nai-kuo)
</P>
<P>
Reform-minded lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Party (DPP)
expressed reservations  Tuesday about a proposal to establish a
"Third Socialist Party," despite their setbacks in the party
primary for the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The idea of forming another political party was floated by Jou
Yi-cheng, chief executive of the Generations Forum -- an
organization made up of DPP young Turks. He claims that Taiwan's
moderate voters are tired of the constant bickering and clashes
between the DPP and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and that
they need another party to reflect their values.
</P>
<P>
Jou, who formerly served as director of the DPP's Department of
Youth Development and as a presidential adviser, told reporters
that the escalating conflict between the ruling and opposition
parties and the endless infighting within the DPP has prompted
him to make up his mind to leave the DPP and form the Third
Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Jou's plan, four-term DPP Legislator Hung
Chi-chang, a bigwig of the disbanded New Tide faction that
championed reform, said that although Jou's spirit deserves
encouragement, the time is not ripe yet for the establishment of
such a political party.
</P>
<P>
Hung said that maybe there is room in Taiwan for such a party in
the future, but added that under the current circumstances, it
would be extremely difficult for Jou to form a third political
force outside the DPP-led "pan-green camp" and the KMT-led "pan-
blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
Hung, who has been listed as one of the "11 nemeses" within the
DPP who have dared to criticize the party and call for reform, is
the only former New Tide member who has secured an at-large seat
in the next legislature.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng, another New Tide member who was
roundly defeated in the DPP primary, also said the time is not
right for Jou to form his party and suggested that Jou wait until
after the year-end legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said he would wish Jou good luck although he added that he
would not leave the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Former DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, who also suffered a setback
in the DPP primary, said he would be willing to assist the Third
Socialist Party and become a volunteer worker, but suggested that
Jou should ponder carefully whether the idea of a Third Socialist
Party will get a warm public response and how long the party can
survive.
