PRESIDENT CAUTIOUS ABOUT PROPOSAL TO DESIGNATE 'INDEPENDENCE DAY'
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  16:11:29 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday the government will conduct
careful discussion on a proposal to designate Oct. 25 as "Taiwan
independence Day."
</P>
<P>
Bruce Herschensohn, a professor of public policy at Pepperdine
University in California, the United States, put forth the
proposal during a meeting with Chen in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Oct. 25 this year will mark the 36th anniversary of
Taiwan's ouster from the United Nations, Herschensohn suggested
that the day be declared "Taiwan Independence Day, " a step which
he said will be as historic as the designation of July 4 as
Independence Day in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Herschensohn further proposed that Taiwan stop its bid to enter
the United Nations to avoid gathering in the same hall with other
"infamous governments."
</P>
<P>
In response to the "Taiwan Independence Day" proposal, Chen said
that this is the first time that he has heard such a creative
idea and that he is deeply impressed with it.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said this is a very serious issue that requires
careful discussion.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, if Oct. 25 were to be declared "Taiwan
Independence Day, " his "four noes" commitments to the United
States would become "three noes."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to pledges made in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural
addresses that if China has no intention of using force against
Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan independence, not change the
official name of the country, not include the "state-to-state"
concept on cross-strait relations in the Constitution, and not
promote a referendum to change the cross-strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
The president recalled that on Oct. 25, 2003, many people in
Taiwan took part in a demonstration asking for a referendum on a
new constitution, an event which he said marked the soaring of
the Taiwanese consciousness among the people in this country and
which boosted his support rating for his second presidential
campaign.
