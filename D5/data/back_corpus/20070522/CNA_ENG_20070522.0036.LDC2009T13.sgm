CHINA SCUTTLES TAIWAN'S PLAN TO HOLD AVIATION SAFETY SEMINAR

Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  21:02:33 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
China's obstruction has scuttled Taiwan's plan to sponsor an
annual seminar of the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) , officials
from the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) under the Executive Yuan
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The FSF is an independent, nonpolitical, nonprofit, international
organization engaged in research, auditing, education, advocacy
and publishing to improve aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hung-chih, ASC executive director, won the bid to host the
60th annual international air safety seminar in Taipei in the
second half of 2007 during a Moscow meeting about one year ago.
</P>
<P>
ASC officials said they had been preparing for the meeting since
last year and that the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the
China Aviation Development Foundation had also agreed to
contribute to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But ASC officials said that after China became an FSF member
several years ago, its clout has increased and it has continued
to put pressure on Taiwan since last year.
</P>
<P>
The FSF notified Taiwan early this year that the annual seminar
will be staged by South Korea this year, saying that it wanted to
maintain tri-party friendship between the United States, Taiwan
and China.
</P>
<P>
The ASC officials said they were disappointed by the political
interference and they are now planning to sponsor a flight safety
seminar of their own.
