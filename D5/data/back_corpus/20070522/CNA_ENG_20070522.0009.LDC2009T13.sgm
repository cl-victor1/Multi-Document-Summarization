Vice President Annette Lu traveled to the outlying island of
Kinmen for a short visit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by Deputy Transportation and Communications Minister You
Fang-lai and Deputy Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Liu Teh-
hsun, Lu first headed to the county government-run Kinmen
Kaoliang Liquor Inc., where she toured the distiller's complex.
During the tour, Lu expressed the hope that "the jade dew- like
Kinmen liquor will conquer world markets with its aroma."
</P>
<P>
Lu exhorted the company to strive to make the sorghum-based
kaoliang liquor for which Kinmen is famous into a top liquor
brand name in the world and beat out China's first brand name
Maotai Liquor.
</P>
<P>
The vice president and those accompanying her then proceeded to
the Shuitou Pier to familiarize themselves with operations of the
port, from where direct shipping services between Kinmen and
Fujian Province's Xiamen have been offered since January 2001.
</P>
<P>
They are also scheduled to visit the Kinmen County government and
a Shuitou local community before wrapping up their tour Tuesday
afternoon.
