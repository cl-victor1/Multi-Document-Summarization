U.N.-BID REFERENDUM TO BE HELD IN TANDEM WITH MAJOR ELECTION:

Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  16:09:26 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian expressed his hope Tuesday that a
referendum on the country's bid to join the United Nations under
the name "Taiwan" can be held in tandem with the legislative
elections slated for the end of this year or the presidential
election to be held in early 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
completed the first stage of a signature drive required to launch
a referendum on Taiwan's bid to join the U.N. under the name
"Taiwan" and that the signatures collected will be sent to the
Central Election Commission (CEC) soon.
</P>
<P>
He added that the second stage of the petition will be launched
in the near future to pave the way for the holding of the
U.N.-bid referendum along with the legislative elections this
year or with the presidential election next year.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks during a brief meeting at the
Presidential Office with visiting Michael Warder, vice chancellor
of Pepperdine University of the United States, and Bruce
Herschensohn, a professor at the Pepperdine School of Public
Policy.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the 23 million people of Taiwan have every right
to take part in the U.N. and the World Health Organization (WHO)
and that they should not be deprived of this "collective human
right."
</P>
<P>
Although the efforts will be very difficult, Taiwan will not be
daunted and will launch a bid for full U.N. membership using the
title "Taiwan" in September following its failure in its bid to
join the WHO under the name "Taiwan" earlier this month, Chen
told Warder and Herschensohn.
</P>
<P>
Noting that members of the opposition parties have been reserved
toward these efforts, Chen said he thinks these are the right
things for the DPP administration to strive to accomplish. "We
are on the right side of history, and we will go for it
resolutely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his appreciation to Warder and Herschensohn for
heading to the L.A. international airport to meet him on Jan. 11
during his U.S. stopover en route to Nicaragua, one of Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The president also lauded the book by Herschensohn titled
"Taiwan: The Threatened Democracy" as an inspirational
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
In the book, according to Chen, Herschensohn seemed to be a
little bit confused about why he used the term "to cease the
function" of the National Unification Council and its guidelines,
instead of "scrap" or "abolish."
</P>
<P>
Chen told his guests that regardless of the term used, the goal
was to abrogate the council and its guidelines.
</P>
<P>
He added that the fifth "no" of his "five noes" doctrine no
longer exists.
</P>
<P>
Chen pledged in his 2000 inaugural address that as long as
Beijing had no intention of using military force against Taiwan,
during his time in office, he would not declare independence, not
change Taiwan's name, not add the state-to- state theory to the
Constitution, not promote a referendum on the independence versus
unification issue, and not scrap the National Unification
Guidelines -- positions collectively known as the "five noes"
doctrine.
