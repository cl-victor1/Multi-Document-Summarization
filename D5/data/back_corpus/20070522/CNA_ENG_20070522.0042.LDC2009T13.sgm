A Chinese man from the city of Xiamen in China's Fujian Province
who entered Taiwan from Kinmen illegally, was detained Tuesday at
the Taoyuan International Airport after being sent back from
Canada, National Immigration Administration officials announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to administration officials, the man, surnamed Wei, was
arrested upon arriving at the Canadian airport and deported May
21 by Canadian immigration officials after he was caught trying
to enter Canada on a fake Republic of China passport.
</P>
<P>
Arrested along with Wei were two human traffickers who helped him
sneak from the outlying Kinmen Island to Taiwan and accompanied
him on the flight to Canada, the officials said, adding that the
detention of the pair also led to a crackdown on a five-member
Taiwanese international human smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
Canadian immigration officials were tipped off about Wei's plans
by their Taiwanese counterparts, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is increasingly being used as a transshipment hub by cross
-border human traffickers with an aim of racking up handsome
profits, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Wei arrived on Kinmen May 14 with a 17-member group on a three-
day pleasure trip from Xiamen via the direct shipping routes
maintained between the two sides -- better known as the "mini
three links" -- that also exist between Taiwan's Matsu and the
Fujian ports of Mawei and Quanzhou.
</P>
<P>
But Wei disappeared the next day morning from his hotel after
receiving a cell phone call.
</P>
<P>
Wei was the first fake Chinese tourist visiting Kinmen with the
intention of illegally entering a third country from Taiwan
proper since the inception of the "mini three links" in January
2001. To date, more than 33,000 Chinese tourists from Fujian have
visited Kinmen via the mini links.
