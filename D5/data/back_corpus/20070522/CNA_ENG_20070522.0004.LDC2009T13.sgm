The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has completed the
first stage of a signature drive required to launch a referendum
on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations under the name
"Taiwan," DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the announcement with Frank Hsieh, who is set to be
nominated by the DPP to run in the 2008 presidential election
before sending the signatures to the Central Election Commission
(CEC) in the hope of holding the referendum along either with the
legislative elections at the end of this year, or with the
presidential election early next year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90,000 signatures have been collected, surpassing the
threshold of 80,000, Yu said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said the domestic strife in Taiwan should be turned into
power to strive for Taiwan's dignity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Polls show that more than 70 percent of the public support
Taiwan's launch of a U.N. bid under the name "Taiwan," the former
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the DPP's goal is to transform Taiwan into a normal
country. Although Taiwan has met pressure from China during the
process, he said, the goal can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
If the referendum can be passed, the world will see the Taiwanese
people's will to establish a normal country, Yu said.
