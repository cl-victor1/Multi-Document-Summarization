The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will map out measures to achieve
the new Cabinet's goal of eradicating election bribery and
organized crime, Justice Minister Morley Shih said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks after calling a meeting at the ministry in
response to Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's declaration that
combating bribery is one of the new administration's four major
goals this year.
</P>
<P>
After assuming the premiership, Chang said at a temporary Cabinet
meeting that the government will attach equal importance to the
eradication of bribery and the prevention of bribery.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to achieve a goal that politicians and civil
servants "cannot, dare not, will not, and do not need to" take
bribes, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
The legislative elections, as well as the magistrate and mayoral
elections in 2001 were the "cleanest" in Taiwan's election
history, Chang claimed, adding that the government will crack
down on bribery this year.
</P>
<P>
Chang served as premier from 2000 to 2001.
