Taipei,  May 22 (CNA) 05/22/07  20:29:44 (By Ruth Wang)

Airport sniffer dogs at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
discovered mangoes being illegally brought into the country by a
Thai tourist May 11 that were later found to be infested with the
mango seed weevil, which can cause significant damage to fruit, a
spokesman for the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pest, which has the scientific name sternochetus mangiferae
(fabricius) , mainly affects mango, plum and lychee trees and is
widely distributed around the world.
</P>
<P>
The infestation was confirmed following examination of the fruit
at National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is not a mango seed weevil-affected area, but if
introduced, it could easily become a threat to Taiwan's NT$5.9
billion (US$176.72 million) mango crop and NT$1.8 billion lychee
crop, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reminded visitors that it is illegal to bring
agricultural or livestock products into Taiwan.
