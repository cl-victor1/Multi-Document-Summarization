DPP LAWMAKERS' PETITION FOR CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION
REJECTED
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  24 (CNA) 01/25/07  17:55:05 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
The grand justices Thursday rejected a petition filed jointly by
84 legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party  (DPP)
for a constitutional interpretation reaffirming the president's
immunity from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Grand Justices resolved that the DPP lawmakers'
petition for an interpretation of Constitution Article 52 --
which stipulates criminal immunity for the president -- met none
of the conditions under which the grand justices might initiate
such an review.
</P>
<P>
The grand justices also turned down another petition of the DPP
legislators seeking an injunction against prosecutorial
procedures and trial regarding the "special state affairs fund"
case in which President Chen Shui-bian is implicated.
</P>
<P>
DPP lawmakers  sought  an interpretation  regarding  Chen's
constitutional immunity from prosecution in a bid to clarify
aspects of the on-going "state affairs fund" trial, arguing that
there is a need for the Council of Grand Justices to interpret
Article 52 since the opposition-dominated Legislature had three
times pushed for Chen's recall based on corruption charges and
other charges related to the "special state affairs fund" case.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said it violates of the president's immunity from
prosecution to indict first lady Wu Shu-jen and then name Chen as
a "joint perpetrator."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution indicted Wu on charges of corruption and forgery
Nov. 3, 2006 after determining she had used receipts provided by
others to claim reimbursements totaling NT$14.8 million
(US$450,000) from the president's "state affairs fund" between
July 2002 and March 2006.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that none of the money taken went into his own pocket,
Chen claimed it was necessary to use receipts from different
individuals to muster the necessary funds to engage in secret
diplomatic missions in certain countries because of the confusing
and inconsistent  accounting  system governing expenditures  by
the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taipei District Court ruled Jan. 19 that the six
diplomatic missions cited by the president as having drawn on the
state affairs fund were not secret as the president claimed, and
should be disclosed in court proceedings.
