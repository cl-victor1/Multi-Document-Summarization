Taiwan people who are fed up with news of political bickering
between the ruling and opposition parties got a much-needed
reprieve Thursday when two local women tennis players won a berth
in the fianl of women's doubles at the Australian Open Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although the match took place mid-morning local time, many office
workers in Taipei were planted in front of their television sets
to watch the live broadcast of Taiwan's Chan Yung-jan and Chuang
Chia-jun defeat China's Yan Zi and Zheng Jie 6-3, 6-4 in the
semi-final match.
</P>
<P>
Many in Taiwan were revved up for the match not only because it
was the first time that anyone from Taiwan had made it to the
semi-finals of a Grand Slam tennis tournament, but also because
the opponents were from China, Taiwan's arch political rival, and
because Yan Zi and Zheng Jie were the defending champions of the
women's doubles at the Australian Open and had defeated the
Taiwan pair in the final at the 2007 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
People around the island rejoiced when Chan and Chuang defeated
their Chinese rivals to become the first Taiwan tennis players
ever to advance to a Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
Chan and Chuang will face Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Liezel Huber
of South Africa in the final on Friday.
