PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REGRETS COURT'S INSISTENCE ON REVIEWING FILES
</HEADLINE>

Taipei.  Jan.  23 (CNA) 01/23/07  12:23:01 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office expressed deep regret Tuesday over the
Taipei District Court's insistence on unsealing three sets of
document files concerning the alleged "special state affairs
fund" misuse scandal.
</P>
<P>
If national interests and security fall victim to the court's
move, it added, those who are behind the decision should be held
accountable and dealt with in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The document files in question include records of President Chen
Shui-bian being questioned by Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen last August
over his alleged misuse of his discretionary "state affairs
fund," as well as documents submitted by the president to the
prosecutor at that time.
</P>
<P>
The documents said to include those on six secret diplomatic
missions financed by the "state affairs fund" were classified at
the president's request after Chen Jui-jen completed his
investigations to prevent the release of secret diplomatic
information.
</P>
<P>
Whether the documents should be unsealed became a focus of debate
between the prosecution and the defense after the trial of the
alleged "state affairs fund" misuse case began last December.
</P>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-jen was indicted on charges of corruption in
early November for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8 million
(US$449,642) from the "fund."
</P>
<P>
The district court ruled last Friday that the six diplomatic
missions cited by the president as having used the "state affairs
fund" are not "state secrets" as defined by the Classified
National Security Information Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
Against  this backdrop,  the court further ruled that the
previously classified documents will be unsealed for attorneys
and prosecutors in charge of the case to review Jan. 23 if
President Chen fails to offer an explanation as to the status of
the documents by Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
A Presidential Office spokesman said it is deplorable that the
district court insists on opening the critical document files
even after the Presidential Office clearly explained the issue
Monday in terms of the fundamental principles and spirit of
constitutional democracy.
</P>
<P>
If national security and interests are at stake, the spokesman
said, those who are behind the court decision should be held
responsible for any possible fallout.
</P>
<P>
In a letter Monday to the Taipei District Court, the Presidential
Office wrote: "What the court requested to unveil are state
secrets which should never be disclosed to avoid hobbling the
country's security, image and overall well- being."
</P>
<P>
The letter further said that any disagreement over the "state
secrets privilege" vested by the Constitution in the president to
facilitate the execution of his official duties should be settled
through procedures set forth in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
President Chen himself is immune from prosecution while in
office, but prosecutors claimed that there is sufficient evidence
to pursue similar charges against him after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer-turned-president has denied any wrongdoing with regard
to the "state affairs fund." But he promised that if his wife
were to be found guilty in the first trial, he would resign.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that history will return justice to me, and the
judicial process will clear my name, " he said in a Nov. 5
televised speech.
