DEMOCRACY BEST WEAPON AGAINST MILITARY EXPANSION: VICE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Taipei, Jan. 23 (CNA) 01/23/07  21:18:00 (By Y.F. Low)

<P>
The dynamic democracies of Taiwan and South Korea prove that
democracy is the best weapon against military expansion and
political isolation by other countries, Vice President Annette Lu
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The examples of Taiwan and South Korea not only show that
democracy can be achieved in countries that adhere to
Confucianism but also indicate that democratization can be
completed amid a military threat, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president  made the remarks  while addressing  a round-
table discussion for the Asian region of the Community of
Democracies held in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some Asian countries have made great progress in
terms of democratization over the past three decades, Lu said the
number of Asian countries classified as "free" by the U.S.-based
Freedom House has increased from only two 30 years ago to six in
2007, including India, Indonesia, South Korea and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Despite  the improvements,  there  have  been examples  of
democratization going backward, the most of obvious of which is
last year's military coup in Thailand, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the suppression of domestic political activities by
dictatorial regimes in China, Myanmar and North Korea have become
a major cause of conflict in these countries, Lu said, adding
that this is not a regional phenomenon but "a sign of global
democratization coming to a standstill."
</P>
<P>
She said the trend is seen from the Freedom House annual Freedom
in the World reports, which show no increase in the number of
free countries around the world since 1998.
</P>
<P>
As the ideas of freedom and democracy are being spread around the
world, dictatorial regimes are joining forces to resist the
trend, using national security or cultural or religious
differences as excuses, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the best way to disprove the claims of these
dictatorial regimes is to share with the world the
democratization stories of Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
While the democratization and economic success of India testify
that no compromise is required between prosperity and democracy,
the "success story" of Indonesia demonstrates that the world's
largest Islamic country can also embrace the universal values of
freedom and human rights, according to Lu.
