Taipei,  Jan. 23 (CNA) 01/23/07  15:53:49 (By Y.F. Low)

The government remains determined to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) and is adopting various pragmatic and flexible
strategies to promote the bid, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Chung, director-general of the ministry's
Department of International Organizations, it was a decision made
with strategic consideration that the government did not file an
application for WHO observer status during the latest World
Health Assembly's Executive Board session which opened Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the Executive Board is not the main
decision-making body that determines whether Taiwan can become an
observer of the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, of more than 30 member nations on the Executive Board,
only El Salvador maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan,
meaning Taiwan will enjoy very little chance of success even if
it files an application, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MOFA spokesman David C.Y. Wang admitted that China has
made the situation even more difficult for Taiwan by claiming
that it has reached an understanding with the WHO Secretariat on
the issue of Taiwan's participation in the WHO.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Taiwan  will continue  to communicate  with the
international community to disprove China's claim and to remove
Beijing's technical interference.
