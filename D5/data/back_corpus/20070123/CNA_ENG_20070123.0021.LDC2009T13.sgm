Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA) 01/23/07  17:31:43 (By Lilian Wu)

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate for the 2008 presidential
election would best be produced through consensus.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks in Hualien while attending a
ceremony marking the delivery of new tilting trains to the Taiwan
Railway Administration. The new trains will operate between
Taipei and Hualien, reducing the existing journey time by 30
minutes for a one-way trip of about two hours.

<P>
Su noted that while the DPP has its own mechanisms for producing
a presidential candidate, the party has to respect every aspirant
in elections.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he "is preparing the way for every one who
hopes to throw a hat into the ring."
</P>
<P>
"So long as I'm doing my job well, the DPP will have the edge in
the year-end legislative elections and 2008 presidential
election, " he explained.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether a primary or a coordination is better in producing
the party's presidential candidate, the premier also said that
"arriving at a consensus through coordination would definitely be
better because of the attending harmonious atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that the most important thing for the party
is to unite, adding that all party members should realize the DPP
has traveled a bumpy road to achieve ruling-party status and that
its supporters expect cohesion.
</P>
<P>
The premier's words came on the heels of remarks by Vice
President Annette Lu, also a DPP hopeful for the presidential
election, who said that it is better to produce the candidate
through consensus, and only if that is impossible, then a primary
should be held.
