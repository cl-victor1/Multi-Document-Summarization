</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  23 (CNA) 01/23/07  18:40:04 (By Maubo Chang)
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 civil groups called on the legislature Tuesday to
hold an extraordinary session and act on the government's 2007
budget, threatening to punish any legislators who ignore their
calls with votes for their opponents in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Chung-hua, a representative of these groups criticized
lawmakers at a news conference for engaging in partisan bickering
while overlooking the interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Shaming the lawmakers for what he claimed is a failure of their
duty to examine the government's budget, Kuo said the 25 groups
he represents are preparing to form a umbrella alliance to
monitor the performance of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Unless the lawmakers correct their errors by sitting without pay
in an extraordinary session to deal with the government's budget,
Kuo said his groups will encourage voters to punish them in the
next legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Kuo's views were echoed at the news conference by Chi Hui-jung,
chief executive officer of the Garden of Hope Foundation. Chi
said the legislature should improved its performance in the
extraordinary session although this may be difficult given the
failures of the regular session.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many lawmakers are savage, corrupted and spoiled due
to voters's indulgence, Chi said the new alliance under formation
will monitor performance in the legislature and recommend the
voters to vote for or against legislators in the next elections
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The comments were made three days after the legislature recessed
in chaos without passing the government's much-needed budget.
</P>
<P>
During their last sitting of the session, lawmakers of the
opposition and ruling parties locked horns over a bill concerning
the organization  of the Central Election Commission.  The
sitting culminated in a free-of-all on the floor, scenes from
which were broadcast nationwide on TV.
