ROC-NICARAGUA TIES REMAIN CORDIAL: MOFA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 5 (CNA) 01/06/07  10:05:40 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Relations between the Republic of China and Nicaragua will remain
close and cordial after the inauguration of the new Nicaraguan
government, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hou Ching-shan said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
As Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel Ortega said during the
presidential campaign that if elected, he would switch diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing, some media outlets have
questioned the viability and sustainability of Taiwan-Nicaragua
ties after Ortega's inauguration Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs news conference held
after the Presidential Office's announcement that President Chen
Shui-bian will leave for Nicaragua Jan. 8 to attend Ortega's
inauguration, Hou said Taiwan-Nicaragua relations have been in
good shape and will remain so in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hou, who visited Nicaragua shortly after Ortega's electoral
victory late last year, said the incoming Nicaraguan government
highly treasures the long-standing cooperative ties with Taiwan
and expects Taiwan to continue assisting Nicaragua in public
health, education and agricultural development in the future.
</P>
<P>
After  extensive   talks  with  many  of  Nicaragua's ministers-
designate, Hou said he is convinced relations between the two
countries will remain firm and cordial after the transition of
power in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nicaragua has been one of the staunchest supporters
of Taiwan's bid to join major international organizations in
recent years, Hou said he sees no problems in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Presidential  Office Deputy Secretary-General  Liu Shih-fang
announced earlier in the day that President Chen will leave for
Nicaragua  Monday  to attend  the inauguration  of Nicaraguan
President-elect Daniel Ortega Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, President Chen will stay overnight in San
Francisco on Jan. 8 before departing early the next day for
Nicaragua, one of the country's diplomatic allies in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
For the return journey, Chen will transit in Los Angeles but only
stop long enough for the plane to refuel, Liu said, adding that
the president is scheduled to return to Taipei Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Chen's attendance at Ortega's inauguration  is
expected to further boost bilateral exchanges and cooperation
based on an existing foundation, Liu said the president will
convey the regards of Taiwan's people and government and the
country's best wishes for Ortega.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Republic of China government, Liu also expressed
gratitude for the U.S. government's consent to Chen's transit
stop request in line with the principles of "safety, convenience,
comfort and dignity" for the travelers.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. assistance marks a smooth start to the president's
upcoming overseas trip, " Liu said, adding that the ROC
government appreciates the Bush administration's generosity in
agreeing to Chen's transit request.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Chen will honor Taiwan-U.S. agreements concerning his
transit visit.
</P>
<P>
"The president will keep a low profile and will, in principle,
refrain from engaging in any public activities during his transit
stay," she added.
</P>
<P>
Liu denied media reports that the Bush administration didn't
agree to Chen's transit request in the continental U.S. until
after ascertaining that Chen hadn't made any overtures in his New
Year's Day speech that would provoke Beijing or destabilize
relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"The report was sheer speculation," Liu contended.
