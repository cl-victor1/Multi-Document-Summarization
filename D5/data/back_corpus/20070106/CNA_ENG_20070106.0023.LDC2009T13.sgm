Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced Saturday that the municipal
government will implement the single-version textbook policy for
all schools in the city in September, 2008.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reporter's question during a visit to the Taipei
Public Service Institute, Hau said the policy, which was a major
part of his platform in the Dec. 9 mayoral election, will not be
in violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
He further said that he had originally planned to launch the
policy, which is aimed at reducing pressure on students, this
September but had to change his plans after discovering that more
time will be required to make related preparations.
