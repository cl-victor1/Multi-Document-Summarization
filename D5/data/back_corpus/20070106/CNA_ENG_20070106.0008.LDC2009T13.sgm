Taiwan's inflation rate registered at 0.6 percent for 2006,
marking the lowest level over the past three years, according to
tallies released Friday by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index (CPI) stood at 104.3 in December, up 0.7
percent over the year-earlier level, DGBAS officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the low inflation rate in 2006 to the
drop in food prices, thanks largely to stable vegetable and fruit
supply owing to good weather.
</P>
<P>
While vegetable prices declined 8.95 percent compared with 2005
-- when vegetable supply was affected by a string of typhoons,
fruit prices only increased slightly by 1.04 percent, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the CPI will rise 1.5 percent for 2007 due to
soaring international raw material prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the wholesale price index was up 5.64 percent in 2006
compared with the previous year, for the largest increase over
the last two years, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
While import prices rose 8.83 percent in 2006, export prices
climbed 2.51 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, mineral prices increased 20.65 percent, with gravel
prices moving up 31.21 percent, prices of petroleum and coal
products rising 18.87 percent, and metal prices going up 19.49
percent, they said.
