Nantou tea growers called a news conference Monday to protest
against substandard  imports they said have seriously affected
their livelihoods and call for the government to address the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of a Nantou tea grower's self-help association
urged the government to help them overcome the negative impact of
substandard foreign imports on their business. Nantou County in
central Taiwan is one of the country's major tea production areas
and its oolong tea is world famous.
</P>
<P>
According to local tea producers, many varies of foreign tea have
failed to pass Taiwan's quarantine requirements, but it is widely
speculated that some tea importers are bringing unqualified goods
into the country without being subject to quarantine control
simply by paying NT$30,000 (around US$900) for each container
they declare.
</P>
<P>
They asked lawmakers of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party present at the
news conference to help investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Chien Tsan-shang relayed former President
Lee Teng-hui's deep concern for Taiwan tea farmers' livelihoods,
pointing out that cheap tea imported from Vietnam and China has
dealt a heavy blow to local growers' business. Lee is the TSU's
so-called "spiritual leader."
</P>
<P>
"The TSU is fully poised to help Taiwan tea farmers tackle the
dumping as the party has also helped resolve similar incidents
involving the dumping of cheap Chinese towels and footwear,"
Chien said.
</P>
<P>
TSU lawmaker Tseng Tsahan-deng asked the central government take
concrete measures to subsidize local tea growers and effectively
carry out quarantine for foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
Tseng also said that some foreign tea is being fraudulently
packaged as locally produced tea and sold on TV shopping channels
at NT$2,180 for two kilograms -- an extremely low price compared
to genuine Taiwanese tea.
</P>
<P>
In the news conference, farmers, lawmakers and county councilors
also set fire to foreign imports to express their strong protest.
