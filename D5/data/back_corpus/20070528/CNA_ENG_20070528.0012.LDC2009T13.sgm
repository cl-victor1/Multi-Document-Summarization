EX-PRESIDENT HAS NO PLAN TO VISIT CHINA: TSU CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

New York,  May 27 (CNA) 05/28/07  15:51:52 (By Hwang Jaw-pyng and
Y.F. Low)
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui has no plan to visit China, either
now or after next year's presidential election, opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who is on a visit to the United States, told reporters
that the TSU does not oppose the idea of fielding its own
candidate for the March 2008 presidential election, but the party
has had no plan to do so up to this point.
</P>
<P>
On a proposal by some TSU supporters that Lee run in the
election, Huang said the chances of Lee accepting the proposal
are slim.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Lee -- the spiritual leader of the TSU --
supports politicians who genuinely strive for Taiwan's interests,
rather than those who "say one thing and do another."
</P>
<P>
In deciding on which political party to support in the coming
presidential election, the TSU will take into account which one
will best protect Taiwan's identity and best serve Taiwan's
interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the year-end legislative elections, Huang admitted that the
TSU might not be able to win as many legislative seats as it did
in the previous  elections, owing to the implementation  of the
"single-member constituency, two-vote" system and the reduction
in the number of legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the situation, the TSU will follow a "center-left"
line to try to attract neutral voters with the goal of winning at
least six seats, he said, adding that the party will "transcend
the pan-blue versus pan-green struggle and the unification
versus independence dispute" and will instead focus on issues
concerning disadvantaged groups and the middle-class.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that he has consulted with DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
about the possibility of TSU-DPP cooperation in the legislative
elections but that the DPP has not responded positively to the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
This is Huang's second visit to the United States since taking
over as TSU chairman in January this year. In addition to New
York, Huang has visited San Francisco and will go to New Jersey
before returning to Taiwan May 31.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Huang will meet with TSU officials posted in the
United States, attend seminars with Taiwanese expatriates and
visit members of the U.S. Congress.
