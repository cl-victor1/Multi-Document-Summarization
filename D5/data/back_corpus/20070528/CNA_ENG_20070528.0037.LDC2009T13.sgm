TAIWAN INVENTS WORLD'S FIRST `HARMLESS DETECTOR' OF BRAIN NERVES

Taipei, May 28 (CNA) 05/28/07  21:02:37 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
Scientists at a university in Taiwan have developed the world's
first "harmless brain nerve detection system" that can record a
person's brainwaves throughout the course of a whole day to help
doctors make diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
Terry B.J. Kuo, director of the Institute of Brain Science under
National Yang- Ming University's School of Medicine, told a
conference at National Taiwan University that the device does not
cause any pain or discomfort and that a patient using the new
invention does not even need go to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Kuo explained that the patient can wear the device like a
hairpin, which will record all the brainwave information of the
patient throughout a whole day.
</P>
<P>
The patient can then send the recorder with the brainwave
information  to the doctor through the mail or transmit  the
information through the Internet for an analysis to be made on
the function of the patient's cerebral nervous system.
</P>
<P>
The use of the instrument can allow patients to avoid having an
X-ray, blood or biopsy tests when receiving treatment for
headaches, insomnia or amnesia, Kuo said.
</P>
<P>
If an abnormality is discovered, the patient only needs to go
through a 20-minute nuclear magnetic resonance imaging process to
create a three- dimensional image of the brain. The image can
expose every detail of the brain's nervous system so that the
doctor can use the information to pinpoint the problem and decide
how to treat it, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the research team that developed the "harmless brain
nerve detection system," the new device should be available for
clinical use in two years and for family use in four to five
years.
