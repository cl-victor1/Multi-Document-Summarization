Taiwan-born pitcher Wang Chien-ming, who plays for the New York
Yankees in the U.S. Major League, will be featured on U.S. sports
channel ESPN in mid-June in two clips that introduce Wang's
baseball career as well as promoting Taiwan tourist attractions,
ESPN Taiwan announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
ESPN will air the two two-minute clips under the title "Wang
Chien-ming: Taiwan's Glory" in North America. A complete 10-clip
series will be broadcast every Tuesday and Thursday in Taiwan
starting May 29, ESPN Taiwan said.

The feature, which contains interviews with Wang, his coaches and
teammates in Taiwan and the Yankees, will be aired during
"Baseball Tonight, " one of the most popular baseball programs in
North America, ESPN Taiwan Vice General Manager Jiang Yi-fang
said.

Wang, who had a brilliant second season with the Yankees last
year with 19 wins and 4 losses and ranked second in American
League Cy Young award voting, tells how he first started playing
in elementary school by "accident" and described his experience
as a batboy during professional baseball games played in his
hometown of Tainan as a junior high school student.

Coaches and teammates of Wang's early career also talk about
Wang's persistence and hard work.

U.S. viewers will also be able to see many tourist attractions in
Taiwan, such as the 101 building and nightmarkets, making the NT$
10 million project sponsored by the Tourism Bureau worthwhile,
according to Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai.

Around 92.28 million households in the U.S. are expected to watch
the clips, she said.
