MA-WANG TICKET STILL TOP OPTION: KMT OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 28 (CNA) 05/28/07  19:11:06 (By Flor Wang)

Responding to speculation that attempts to create a presidential
ticket between former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng have failed,
KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said Monday that Ma still firmly
hopes Wang will serve as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
Wu Den-yih made the remarks to reporters  amid widespread
speculation that Ma and Wang are unlikely to pair up in the next
presidential poll after Wang told local media that he prefers to
"collaborate" with Ma instead of forming a ticket with him. Ma
won the KMT's nomination early this month to run in the 2008
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Wang's words are viewed as evidence that the much-discussed Ma-
Wang ticket is out of the question. Ma has repeatedly said that
Wang would be his first choice of running mate.
</P>
<P>
Wang is slated to meet with KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung Tuesday for
talks on presidential ticketing issues, and Wu Po-hsiung is
expected to invite Wang to serve as the party's No. 1 at-large
legislator should the Tuesday meeting also fail, a media report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Den-yih, Wang is to date Ma's only and best
choice for running mate and every possible effort should be made
to help make the ticket a reality.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of whether Ma has begun considering other
possible hopefuls to replace Wang, Wu Den-yih said that he has
not noticed such a development. "Ma has not talked to me about
such a matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Den-yih, also a KMT lawmaker, declined to comment on a
proposal suggesting that he become Ma's running mate.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lee Jih-chu, who speculators have said could also
be a possible running mate, said that she still looks forward to
seeing a Ma-Wang ticket.
</P>
<P>
"I fully support a Ma-Wang ticket until the last minute, " Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
According to KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao, who maintains close links
with Ma, the ex-KMT head has not considered any alternatives to
Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Ma is very sincere in inviting Wang to form a presidential
ticket with him, and we will be waiting for that to happen until
the last minute," Lai said,  adding that "a final decision will
be made after Ma and Wang meet in the coming two days."
