Monitoring indicators for Taiwan's economic climate flashed a
yellow-blue light for April, signalling a slowdown, according to
a report released Monday by the Council for Economic Development
and Planning (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
The total monitoring score lost five points from 23 in March to
18 in April, with the indicators turning from the green that
indicated steady growth in March, CEPD officials said.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine component indicators, three showed losses -- bank
clearings and remittances, exports, and industrial production --
the officials said, adding that the other six indicators remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the
economy's outlook in the coming three months -- stood at 110.0 in
April, down 0.2 percent from the month-earlier level, they said.
</P>
<P>
Among the seven indicators comprising the composite index, five
made negative contributions -- customs-cleared exports, stock
prices, floor rate of building construction permits, new orders
for the manufacturing sector and average work hours in the
manufacturing sector -- according to the CEPD.
</P>
<P>
The index of coincident indicators, which represents the current
economic situation, registered 109.6 in April, down 0.4 percent
from March, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Among the six indicators making up the index, the two that made
negative contributions were industrial production and
manufacturing production, they went on.

<P>
Meanwhile, a CEPD survey of manufacturers in April indicates that
16 percent of the respondents expect conditions to improve over
the next three months, up from 14 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 percent of the respondents  predicted that
conditions will be worse, up from a revised 12 percent in the
previous month, while 70 percent expect the conditions to remain
the same, down from a revised 74 percent in March.
