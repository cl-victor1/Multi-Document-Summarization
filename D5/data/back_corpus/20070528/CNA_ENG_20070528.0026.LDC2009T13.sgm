POOR QUALITY DENTURES HARMFUL TO WEARERS: DENTIST
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 28 (CNA) 05/28/07  18:52:40 (By Maubo Chang)

Dentures made with cheap metal will harm their wearers in the
long term by releasing harmful ingredients, a dentist warned
Monday amid reports that many local dentists use poor quality
false teeth made in China.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Chi-chih,  a dentist and associate  professor  at the
Taichung-based Chung Shan Medical University, said in Taipei that
false teeth used to be made with alloy and covered with a
porcelain or ceramic crown to make them look like real teeth.
</P>
<P>
The alloy used for the inner part of false teeth is usually made
with gold and platinum, which are stable and closely compatible
with the gums of the wearers.
</P>
<P>
As gold and platinum are expensive, Hsu said, some dentures are
made with a cheap alloy of beryllium, chromite and nickel, which
are half the price of gold and platinum.
</P>
<P>
However, these teeth are not as compatible with the wearers' gums
release harmful metal isotopes in the long term, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
An alternative to gold- and platinum-based teeth is ceramic
teeth, which are as strong as metal-based teeth despite the
absence of metal inner parts and similar to natural teeth in
color.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one in every 15 people over the age of 12 in Taiwan
wears false teeth or dentures, Hsu recommend that people choose
safe rather than cheap prosthetic teeth.
