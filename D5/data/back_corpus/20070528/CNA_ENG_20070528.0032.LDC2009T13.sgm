JAPAN'S YONAGUNI ISLAND TO SET UP BRANCH OFFICE IN HUALIEN
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,   May  28  (CNA) 05/28/07  19:55:27 (By Chris Wang)

Yonaguni Island of Japan's Okinawa Prefecture will set up a
branch office in the eastern Taiwan city of Hualien Tuesday with
the goal of improving the island's ties with its sister city on
all fronts and facilitating more cooperation, Yonaguni city
officials said Monday in a press conference in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Yonaguni Island, Japan's westernmost point at the end of the
Ryukyu Islands chain, lies only 111 km east of Hualien and had
extensive exchanges with Hualien before World War II. As Taiwan
was no longer a Japan territory after the war, exchanges between
both sides became limited.
</P>
<P>
It became the first Japanese city and the second Japanese local
government to set up a branch office in Taiwan, following Okinawa
Prefecture, which has established an office in Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
"As an outlying island, we have been dealing with difficulties in
local development for many years. Japan has entered an age of
`decentralization' as each local autonomy is required to develop
identity, self governance and creativity for its own prosperity,
" Yonaguni Mayor Hokama Syukichi said.
</P>
<P>
Hokama said Yonaguni seeks to boost its cooperation with Hualien
due to their proximity.
</P>
<P>
Hokama led a delegation including City Council Speaker Sakihara
Sonkichi, Deputy Speaker Maenisihara Takezou, three councilors
and office staff that will attend the inauguration ceremony
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hokama and Hualien Mayor Tsai Chi-ta signed a cooperation
agreement in October last year in which both sides agreed to
collaborate on economic exchanges, tourism promotion and
emergency relief. The most important aspect for the 1,700
residents of the island  will be direct  flights,  shipping
lines and fishing cooperation, Hokama said.
</P>
<P>
"On sunny days, you can see Taiwan's coastline from Yonaguni
Island, " said Ma Chuan-sheng, an 82-year-old Hualien native who
volunteered to help with the exchange project. By improving
mutual cooperation, Ma said, Yonaguni residents will be able to
check into hospitals in Hualien in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
In April 2005, the Yonaguni city council passed a resolution
stating  that the island sought to devote itself to its own
development by more cooperation with neighboring countries such
as Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Later, when its plan to set up a "national border exchange
special zone" was rejected by the Japanese government, more
radical solutions were discussed by locals, including declaring
independence, pushing the island into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has since softened its stance by agreeing
to provide needed help in the exchange project, Hokama added.
