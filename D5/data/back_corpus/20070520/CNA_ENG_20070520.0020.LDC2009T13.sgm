President Chen Shui-bian donated NT$10,000 (US$300) worth of
cakes to the Children Are Us Foundation for auction and served as
the foundation's boy scout leader Sunday as part of his volunteer
services marking the seventh anniversary of his presidential
inauguration.

<P>
Chen made the donation upon his arrival at True Love Pier in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung at 1: 20 p.m., after taking a
ferry from Hsiaoliuchiu off the southernmost county of Pingtung,
to a warm welcome from Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san and a
group of children from the foundation headed by its chairwoman,
Hsiao Shu-chen.

Despite heavy rainfall, President Chen seemed elated at the
moment when a child invited him to assume the role of boy scout
leader and presented him with a boy scout neckerchief. After Chen
made the cake donation, he asked the children to pose for a group
photo with him.

<P>
Chen also promised to serve as a social volunteer to do many more
meaningful things after his term as president ends next year.
