TSU LAUNCHES PETITION FOR DEFERRING INCOME TAX RETURN FILING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei, May 20 (CNA) 05/20/07  17:33:55 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) launched an online
petition campaign  Sunday to push for the government to extend
the deadline for filing individual income tax returns from May 31
to the date that the central government's 2007 budget plan clears
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the campaign followed a relay sit-in which the TSU
started May 3 in front of the legislature to push for early
passage of the budget plan, which should have been passed by the
Legislative Yuan during its previous session.
</P>
<P>
The legislature's delay in approving the budget plan has hindered
the implementation of several major national development
projects, thus triggering a decline in Taiwan's economic growth
rate, a TSU official claimed, adding that under these
circumstances, the public has the right to refuse to pay their
income taxes. The official said that since May 1, the government
has urged the public to file their individual income tax returns
for 2006 as early as possible but has not informed taxpayers that
the government's budget has not cleared the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that it is "illegitimate and unconstitutional" for the
government to levy income taxes while the budget plan for 2007
remains dormant in the legislature, the official called for the
public to sign the petition at www.tsu.org.tw. to defend their
own rights.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the TSU will forward all petition
information to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan and the
Control Yuan, as well as the headquarters of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) to convey the public's anger and discontent over
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's Budget Law, the Executive Yuan's budget plan
for 2007 should have cleared the legislature Nov. 31, 2006.
However, the budget has been delayed for more than five months
due to incessant partisan bickering over a KMT-drafted amendment
bill on the organization of the Central Election Commission (CEC)
, under which CEC members would be recommended by political
parties in proportion to the number of seats they hold in the
legislature. The ruling DPP opposed the notion.
