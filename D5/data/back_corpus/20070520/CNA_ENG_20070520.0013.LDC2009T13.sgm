Taipei,  May 20 (CNA) 05/20/07  18:01:47 (By Deborah Kuo)

<P>
Premier-designate Chang Chun-hsiung urged members of his new
administrative team Sunday to "race against time" to accomplish
the tasks that President Chen Shui- bian has instructed should be
carried out before the president's term ends in about one year.
</P>
<P>
Chang was appointed by Chen as the new premier May 14 to succeed
outgoing Premier Su Tseng-chang after Su submitted his
resignation May 12, one week after he lost the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party presidential primary to his predecessor Frank
Hsieh.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held on the eve of the new Cabinet's
swearing-in ceremony, Chang vowed to lead his team to achieve the
five directives that the president put forward upon appointing
him as the new premier.
</P>
<P>
The five directives are: Insist on Taiwan-centric consciousness
and materialize social  justice;  secure development  with an
environmental protection mindset; promote what is beneficial and
abolish what is harmful; take good care of the central and
southern regions, middle and lower-echelons of society, and
small- and medium-sized  enterprises;  and run the government
humbly and consolidate Taiwan powerfully.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he will strive to complete his missions based on four
mottos: hard work, communication, efficiency and breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang lauded Su for having led the Cabinet to perform
commendably over the past year, including having managed to lower
the unemployment rate to 3.9 percent, achieve economic growth of
4.6 percent, enable the stock market to return to the 8,000-point
level, and promote the "Mega Investment" and "Mega Warmth"
campaigns to boost domestic investment and social reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Chang also called for members of the Legislative Yuan to render
their greatest possible support to him and the new Cabinet in the
hopes that the legislature and the administration will "cooperate
instead of confront each other" in the future.
