Taipei,  May 20 (CNA) 05/20/07  17:31:28 (By Luis Huang)

Economic Affairs Minister Steve R.L. Chen said Sunday that
despite the fact that the government's plan to build a "Taiwan
Park" in El Salvador has been suspended, his ministry will
continue to encourage Taiwan manufacturers to invest in the
Central American country.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Economic Affairs will continue to encourage
Taiwanese entrepreneurs to invest in El Salvador by making the
best of a just-inked Taiwan-El Salvador-Honduras Free Trade
Agreement (FTA)," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who on behalf of the government signed the trilateral
agreement with his Salvadoran and Honduran counterparts May 8 in
the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, added that future
investment by Taiwan manufacturers will not focus on any special
investment area.
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran President Antonio Saca, who was also present at the
signing ceremony, announced at a press conference that the
Taiwan-El Salvador park building project had been suspended after
an exchange of notes between the presidents of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the "Taiwan Park" was initiated by Vice
President Annette Lu during a diplomatic trip to Central America
in 2005, with relevant government agencies, such as the MOEA, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the National Science
Council, put in charge of planning construction details.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hou Ching-shan  said the
government originally planned to arrange for companies in
Taiwan's textile sector to set up factories in the park, adding
that El Salvador also accepted the plan.
</P>
<P>
After  conducting  evaluations  on  its  industrial  future
development, the Salvadoran government decided to give top
priority to developing high-tech industries in the planned park,
but because few Taiwanese high-tech businesses were willing to
invest in the country,  the government could not but respect its
Salvadoran counterpart's decision to suspend the plan, Hou
explained.
</P>
<P>
Hou further said that El Salvador is still looking forward to
more investment by Taiwan entrepreneurs to help boost its
economic development.
