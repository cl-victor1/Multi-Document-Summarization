A local education foundation has provided over NT$20 million
(US$600,000) in scholarship funds over the last five years as
part of efforts to promote scientific education among high school
students in Taiwan, a spokesman for the foundation said Sunday.

<P>
The remarks came after the Macronix Education Foundation held a
summit meeting Saturday, inviting 30 previous winners of a
scientific award to share their experience with younger students,
the spokesman said.

The foundation established the award in 2002, hoping to use a
scientific contest to arouse local high school students'
interests in natural science and applied science, the spokesman
noted.

Currently, the award has attracted more than 1,400 students to
submit works, and the foundation has offered a total of over
NT$20 million in scholarships, the spokesman said.
