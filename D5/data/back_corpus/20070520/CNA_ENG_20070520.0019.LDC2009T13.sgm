The National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts (TMOA) and Taichung-based
China Medical University (CMU) have forged astrategic alliance to
bolster the development of arts and humanities education, a
cultural official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ava Hsueh, curator of the TMOA under the Council for Cultural
Affairs (CCA), and CMU President Huang Jong-tsun signed a
cooperative agreement last Tuesday aimed at promoting various
cultural and art activities  by using  national  arts education
resources  and facilitating the implementation of the CMU's arts
education plan, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Under the partnership plan, the two sides will take part in a
wide variety of activities based on reciprocity and equality,
such as combining the museum's exhibition tours and workshops
into the university's arts courses.
</P>
<P>
While the CMU will encourage students to serve as volunteers at
the museum, the TMOA in return will provide online art course
resources for the school's students and send exhibition
organizers or artists to deliver lectures at the school, as well
as offer updated information on art and cultural events for the
university's faculty and students.
