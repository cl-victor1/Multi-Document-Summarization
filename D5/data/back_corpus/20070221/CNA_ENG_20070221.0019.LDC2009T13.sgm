LAWSUIT AGAINST REBAR FOUNDER TO BE FILED SHORTLY: LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles,  Feb. 21 (CNA) 02/21/07  20:57:29 (By Lu-sheng Chu
and Deborah Kuo)

Lawyer Chiu Chang, who obtained her doctorate of law (J.D.) in
the United States, said Wednesday that she will represent some
Taiwan creditors to file a lawsuit against fugitive tycoon Wang
You-theng in Los Angeles shortly.
</P>
<P>
Chiu, who was formerly a legislator-at-large of Taiwan's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, said she is sending a copy of a
plaint to Wang, who is currently detained at an immigration
center in San Pedro, California, and will file the plaint to a
court of law in the California High Court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said a news conference will be held in Los Angeles within
days to brief the media how and what she will do as a litigator
representating part of the Taiwan creditors after Wang and his
wife reportedly having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate
funds from the Rebar Asia Pacific Group before fleeing to China
late last year and then to the United States early this year.
</P>
<P>
On Chiu's action, Bern Steves, an expert in international
litigation services, said Wang's case involves a jurisdictional
issue at the initial stage and it is too early to speculate
whether the lawsuit against the Wangs will get to a U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
Steves warned that Wang's attorneys could ask the California High
Court not to accept and hear the suit on the premise that none of
the "crimes" that the Wangs were accused of had occurred in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Wang has been detained at a San Pedro immigration holding center
for illegal entry into the United States since Feb. 2, when he
tried to return to Los Angeles with both his Republic of China
and Dominican Republic passports canceled, following a failed
attempt to flee to Myanmar via Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Following a hearing on the Wang case held in mid-February, a next
hearing is scheduled for March 6 or 7, although U.S. justice
officials would not confirm the information.
</P>
<P>
The tycoon is wanted by Taiwanese authorities for his suspected
involvement in a series of crimes, including forgery, fraud,
insider trading, and embezzlement of corporate funds from his
group.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has been asked by Taiwan law enforcement
authorities to help extradite the Wangs as the two countries
maintain a judicial cooperation pact.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one people related to the Rebar scandal have been probed as
suspects, 13 of whom have been detained. The number of people
related to the case barred from leaving Taiwan has increased to
91.
