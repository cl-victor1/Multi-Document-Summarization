The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has completed the installation of a
nationwide anti-graft website for ordinary citizens to join the
fight against political corruption by reporting suspicious
corrupt cases to relevant law enforcement authorities, an MOJ
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, the official said the MOJ will mobilize all
government ethics units to investigate suspicious governmental
operations in accordance with the ministry's anti-corruption
plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by the Executive Yuan in November 2006,
attacks the problem of corruption from two directions,
"eliminating corruption" and "preventing corruption," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The MOJ set up the website to harness all available energy and
knowledge in its efforts to wipe out political corruption. The
website went live Jan. 15, 2007, showcasing government's
performance in the anti-corruption campaign and keeping the
public informed of its progress.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage people to report cases of corruption, the
MOJ is scheduled to raise the minimum monetary reward from NT$
200,000 (US$ 6,062) to NT$ 300,000, and the maximum reward from
NT$ 6 million to NT$ 10 million, provided that the Executive Yuan
approves of relevant changes to the Anti-Corruption Informant
Rewards and Protection Regulations.
</P>
<P>
The official said the MOJ will also craft strategies and decide
upon key points to thoroughly investigate major irregularities at
governmental institutions, especially those pertaining to
suspicious governmental operations that score poorly on the
integrity index following surveys.
