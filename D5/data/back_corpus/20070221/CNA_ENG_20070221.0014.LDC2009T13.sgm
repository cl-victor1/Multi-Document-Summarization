<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang had a busy day Wednesday, visiting a
nursing home and a coast guard base in Taipei county.
</P>
<P>
Su visited the Shuanglian Nursing Home located in Sanchih, Taipei
County and spent some happy hours with the elders living there.
When Su was asked by the seniors when he will announce his
presidential bid, Su ducked the question, saying only that he has
not ceased for a single day to push for the well-being of the
people of the country.
</P>
<P>
Su -- considered a strong contender to become a 2008 presidential
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and,
according to DPP legislator Wu Ping-jui who accompanied Su during
the visit, likely to announce his presidential bid after the
Lunar New Year holidays -- noted that the country should emulate
Kevin Lin, who had just finished the daunting, unprecedented
cross-Sahara marathon, saying that with perseverance and
determination, everybody will succeed as long as they try hard
enough.
</P>
<P>
Su lauded Lin as having fully demonstrated the "spirit of Taiwan"
by achieving the "impossible dream" of crossing the 7,400-km
Sahara Desert by foot in 111 days, carrying the Republic of China
national flag on his back.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he phoned Lin upon hearing the good news the
night before and told Lin that he is a source of pride for all of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Su visited a coast guard base in Tamshui,
Taipei County and boarded a cutter to gain better understanding
of the coast guard's daily duties, particularly operations to
crack down on smugglers and the interception of illegal
immigrants.
