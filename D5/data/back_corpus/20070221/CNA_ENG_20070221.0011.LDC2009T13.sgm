TAIWAN ULTRA MARATHONER CROSSES SAHARA DESERT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA) 02/21/07  16:32:45 (By Deborah Kuo)

Taiwan's ultra-endurance marathoner Kevin Lin, along with an
American and a Canadian, completed their run across the Sahara
Desert Tuesday (Taipei time) , making the trio the first three
modern runners to cross the Sahara's grueling 7,300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Lin, 30, and his fellow ultra-athletes -- Charlie Engle, 44 and
Ray Zahab, 38 -- reached the Suez Canal at Egypt's Red Sea
Tuesday night after running 111 consecutive days to cross the
Sahara -- the world's largest desert. The trio traversed six
countries, beginning with Senegal, but also including Mauritania,
Mali, Niger and Libya, by the time their trek ended in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The trio endured strong winds, which can abruptly raise sand in
every direction, making it difficult to see and breathe, and
extreme temperatures, which might peak as high as 38 degrees
Celsius during the day but dip below freezing at night, on the
trek, which was originally scheduled to finish in 80 days.
</P>
<P>
They began last November but had to run an extra 200 kilometers
under the surveillance of the Libyan authorities, who at one
point refused to grant them entry visas.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who has traveled the world competing in adventure races,
said during a mobile phone call to his mentor Tuesday night that
running through turbulent conditions is nothing new to him, but
the past 111 days had tested his physical and mental limitations.
</P>
<P>
He had to change his running shoes from size seven to 8.5 due to
swelling, but this had not forced him to rest for one single day,
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Lin, the first Asian to run a seven-day-six-night Sahara marathon
in 2002, is scheduled to return to Taiwan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A film crew followed trio, chronicling their desert journey for a
documentary by actor Matt Damon's production company, LivePlanet.
Damon plans to narrate the documentary, which will be a film
titled "Running the Sahara."
</P>
<P>
At several points in their trek, Lin said, they stopped near
sparsely populated wells to talk with villagers and nomads about
the difficulties they face finding water -- prompting them to
plan a fund-raiser for the nonprofit group H2O Africa, which was
established to raise awareness about the need for clean water
throughout the African continent.
