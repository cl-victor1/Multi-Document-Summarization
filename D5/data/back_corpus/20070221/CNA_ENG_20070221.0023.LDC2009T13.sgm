ITRI CALLS FOR IPR CAPITALIZATION TO BOOST BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY

Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA) 02/21/07  23:44:34 (By Zep Hu)

<P>
Taiwan should promote capitalization and securitization of
intellectual property rights (IPR) to rev up the development of
the knowledge-based  biotechnology industry,  a researcher with
the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee Lien-tze, a research fellow at ITRI's Biomedical Engineering
Research Laboratory, said the R&amp;D-oriented biotechnology
industry tends to require heavy capital investment over a long
period of time to fruition.
</P>
<P>
Citing the pharmaceuticals industry, Lee said the overall time
needed to develop and market a new drug could reach 10 years and
the cost may hit US$1 billion. "Investment in this kind of
industry is highly risky," he added.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the manufacturing-oriented electronic and information
technology (IT) industries, Lee went on, the biotechnology
industry is R&amp;D-oriented and its manufacturing cost is
comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Lee said, the OEM formula commonly used in
the IT industry cannot apply to the biotechnology industry. Any
biotechnology company intending to adopt an OEM business strategy
would face the predicament  of "minimal  profits  and limited
development potential," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to ACER Group founder Stan Shih's "Smiling Curve"
theory,  Lee said R&amp;D is the most profitable  sector of the
pharmaceutical market and the most promising field for Taiwanese
investors to explore.
</P>
<P>
The annual turnover of the global biomedical market reaches an
estimated US$800 billion, of which sales of new pharmaceuticals
account for about US$150 billion, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
To tap this lucrative market, Lee said Taiwan should step up IPR
capitalization or securitization of patenting to offer easier
access to needed R&amp;D funds and accelerate the growth of local
biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
Securitization  is a financing  technique  that allows the
corporation to separate credit origination and funding activities
and can thereby convert illiquid assets into liquid assets to
facilitate business operations and expansion.
</P>
<P>
In Stan Shih's "Smiling Curve" theory, the entire business or
production process comprises three sectors -- R&amp;D,
manufacturing and marketing/services. According to Shih, the
starting point or R&amp;D and access to end users or
marketing/service are the most profitable, while the
manufacturing section is least lucrative.
