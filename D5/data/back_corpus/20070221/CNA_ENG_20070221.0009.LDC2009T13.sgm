The Dulan Police Station in Taitung County's Tungho township
along the east coast -- always a scenic spot -- has become a very
secure camping area for tourists thanks to the 24-hour police
presence, a spokesman for the station said Wednesday.

Luo Kuang-chung, director of Chengkung Police Precinct of the
Taitung County Police Bureau said the idea behind making the
police station into a scenic rest area is to bridge the gap
between the police and people and share the natural beauty of the
scenery surrounding the station with tourists.

The station's free camping spaces can hold about 10 tents at one
time, and no reservations are needed. Tourists may camp there so
long as there is space remaining, provided that they notify the
police. Luo said over 200 people have camped at the station since
March 2006.

With subsidies  from the East Coast National  Scenic Area
Administration provided for its renovation, Dulan Police Station
is now a convenient and beautiful stopping-off point with a
fountain, ecology pond, showers and washing facilities, all free
for those camping at the site.

Campers may also visit nearby pre-historical relics, Dulan Artist
Village, Dulan sugar factory, and Moonlight Inn--once a shooting
location in an old movie. In addition to the Dulan Police
Station, the Tuli Police Station in Taitung County also offers
free camp sites for the public, Luo said.
