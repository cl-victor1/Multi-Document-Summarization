STATUE REMOVAL NOT A RESULT OF GRUDGE: KAOHSIUNG MAYOR
</HEADLINE>

Kaohsiung,  March  27  (CNA) 03/27/07  19:25:23 (By Flor Wang)

Removing the statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek from
the Kaohsiung City's cultural center was not the result of a
political grudge and only aimed to serve cultural ends and step
up ethnic harmony, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions from councilors during a special session
called by the opposition-controlled municipal council to delve
into the reasons for the move, Chen stressed that the Kaohsiung
City Government decided to dismantle the bronze statue mainly to
separate culture from politics, remove symbols of the
authoritarian era and bolster harmony among the countries'
different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Now that Chiang's dictatorial rule, which lay behind the 228
Incident -- a massacre of thousands of Taiwanese elites by
Kuomintang (KMT) troops in 1947 -- has come to an end, it is
inappropriate that Kaohsiung City participate in the propagation
of his political myth, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
She also rejected speculation that the city government's removal
of the statue was intended to cleanse Kaohsiung  of Chiang's
influence, stressing that "the removal of the Chiang's statue is
not the result of a grudge, despite the fact that the process
might not be perfect."
</P>
<P>
Chen promised that if similar operations are contemplated in the
future, she will definitely notify the city council and discuss
the matter with them.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san asserted that the city's
handling of the statue issue was fully lawful.
</P>
<P>
The statue, now reduced to 20 pieces, is being stored in Tahsi
township, northern Taoyuan County, where appropriate authorities
will reconstruct it, she said, adding that people wishing to pay
tribute to Chiang can have a space to do so there.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung City Government tore down the statue at the
municipal Chiang Kai- shek Cultural Center earlier this month,
and transported the remnants to Tahsi township, where mausoleums
of Chiang and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, are located.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung City Council, which had not been informed of the
operation, called an extra session for Monday - Tuesday to
explore the motives behind the municipal authorities' contentious
move.
</P>
<P>
In response to Chen's explanation, Huang Po-lin and Tai Teh-ming,
city councilors of the main opposition KMT, said that they will
propose forming a task force to investigate the demolition of the
statue on the grounds that the city government's decision to do
so was "rash" and the process "flawed."
</P>
<P>
Huang asked that the Kaohsiung City Government provide a report
detailing the legal basis of operations to the KMT's caucus of
the city council by March 30 to facilitate further
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Huang vowed to file a law suit against the Kaohsiung City
Government if it is found to have failed to follow due process.
