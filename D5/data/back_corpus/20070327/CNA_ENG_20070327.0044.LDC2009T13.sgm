TAIPEI EXPRESSES REGRET OVER JAPAN'S COURT RULING ON STUDENT DORM
CASE

Taipei, March 27 (CNA) 03/27/07  22:50:05 (By Han Nai-kuo)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed "deep regret and
disappointment" over a ruling by Japan's highest court in favor
of Beijing with regard to a legal battle between Taiwan and China
over the ownership of a student dormitory in Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a news release that as a nation which
treasures freedom, democracy and the rule of law, Japan should
not have allowed unrelated factors to interfere with its
independent judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh had
said the government would study the ruling before working out a
strategy to deal with the legal battle with China.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks shortly after Japan's highest court
overturned two lower court rulings and returned the case to the
Kyoto District Court, saying that the government in Taipei had
lost its right to claim ownership of the property that belonged
to the Republic  of China on Taiwan after Japan switched
diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials pointed out that the legal battle over
the student dormitory is a sensitive case in that it involves
international and regional politics.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Japan's relationship with China was not cordial
while Junichiro Koizumi was Japan's prime minister, and that
Shinzo Abe has been anxious to improve relations with China since
he succeeded Koizumi as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be too difficult to comprehend that the case
affecting the triangular relationship among Japan, China and
Taiwan could drag on and on," they said.
</P>
<P>
The case involves a student dormitory  in Japan known as
Kuanghualiao in Taiwan. The property was bought in 1952 from
Kyoto University by the Republic of China government in Taipei,
which at that time  was recognized  by Japan  as the sole
legitimate representative of China.
</P>
<P>
Ownership of the dormitory became an issue of contention after
Japan severed diplomatic relations with Taipei and recognized
Beijing in 1972.
</P>
<P>
At the first two trials of the case, both the Kyoto District
Court and the Osaka High Court ruled in favor of the Taipei
government.
</P>
<P>
Taipei has pointed out that the ROC government was exercising
effective jurisdiction over Taiwan when it bought the student
dormitory in 1952, a fact has remained unchanged ever since.
</P>
<P>
It has further argued that the ROC continues to exist, that it
has never been ruled by the communist regime of the People's
Republic of China and that the ROC, represented by its National
Property Bureau, has the right to file claim over the ownership
of the property.
