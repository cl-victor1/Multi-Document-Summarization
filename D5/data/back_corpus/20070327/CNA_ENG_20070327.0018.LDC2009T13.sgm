The quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) is organizing a trade delegation to take part in the
2007 Taitronics India to be held Sept. 14-16 at the Chennai Trade
Center in the Southeast Indian city, a TAITRA official said
Tuesday.

According to the official, the exhibition will be jointly
sponsored by TAITRA and the Taiwan Electrical  and Electronic
Manufacturers  Association  with the aim of helping  Taiwanese
manufacturers introduce Taiwan-made products to potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
Overseas offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and TAITRA
will invite potential buyers from India and member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations to visit the three-day
electronics show, the official pointed out.

The exhibition is expected to attract around 35,000 local and
foreign  buyers as well  as representatives  of international
procurement offices set up by foreign enterprises in India, the
official said, adding that it will be a good chance for Taiwanese
manufacturers to explore trade opportunities.

<P>
According to the official, TAITRA will also host a series of
economic and industrial cooperation seminars during the show and
arrange for Taiwanese participants to make fact-finding visits to
local industrial zones to seek business cooperation with Indian
businesspeople. Domestic manufacturers wishing to participate in
the exhibition are required to register with TAITRA by April 31.

Noting that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has listed India as
one of the major countries with which Taiwan will seek to step up
economic and trade exchanges this year, the official said that
India is expected to become one of the world's top five economies
prior to 2040, so domestic manufacturers should seek to make
inroads into the Indian market.
