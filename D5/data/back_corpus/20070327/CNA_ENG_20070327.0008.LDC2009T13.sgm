Taipei,  March  27 (CNA) 03/27/07  13:29:05 (By Sofia Wu)

The Council of Agriculture (COA) is seeking talks with China on
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in agriculture, an
official with the COA's Food and Agriculture Administration said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that rampant smuggling  of locally developed  plant
varieties and crop breeding know-how to China has caused severe
damage to Taiwan's agricultural development and profitability,
the official said it has become urgent for the COA to negotiate
with China for institutionalized IPR protection in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To protect the legitimate rights of local investors in crop
breeding research and product development, the official said, the
COA has negotiated with the world's major seed trading countries
on mutual acceptance of utility patent applications by their
citizens for inventions in breeding technology and cultivars.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the United States, the European Union, Australia and
Japan have expressed  willingness  to accept Taiwan  citizens'
applications for plant variety patent protection," the official
said, adding that negotiations with the Netherlands, Israel and
Canada are still ongoing for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
As China's counterfeiting and other IPR infringements have been a
primary source of Taiwan farmers' suffering, the official said,
the COA keenly hopes to hold similar talks with China on mutual
IPR protection in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We need to negotiate with China under the same format to secure
institutionalized IPR protection for our crop breeding
researchers and product developers, " the official said, adding
that strong IPR protection "will encourage more investment which
is needed to maintain continued crop improvement required to feed
the people and add value to agriculture and society through new
products."
