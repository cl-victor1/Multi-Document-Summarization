Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Chang Siao-yue said Tuesday that
bilateral relations between Taiwan and Nauru will receive a boost
with the opening of the Nauruan embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks after offering her best wishes to the
Nauruan embassy. David Adeang, Nauruan Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Minister of Finance, presided over the opening of the
embassy earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
Adeang noted that it was a mistake for Nauru to establish
diplomatic relations with China in 2002. Nauru is now redressing
its past wrong by developing substantial and friendly relations
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chieh-yeh, who was
earlier stationed in the South Pacific country, said that he was
glad to see Nauru resume diplomatic relations with Taiwan and
open an embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan first established diplomatic relations with the island
nation in 1980. The two countries severed relations after Nauru
switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan resumed diplomatic ties with Nauru in 2005. Nauruan
President Ludwig Scotty led a delegation to Taiwan for a state
visit in March 2006, and President Chen made a reciprocal visit
in September of that year.
</P>
<P>
Nauruan Ambassador Ludwig D. Keke presented his credentials to
President Chen Shui-bian March 7.
