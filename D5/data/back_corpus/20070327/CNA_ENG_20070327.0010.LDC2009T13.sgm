HONG KONG LEADER URGED TO STRENGTHEN TIES WITH TAIWAN

Taipei,  March 27 (CNA) 03/27/07  13:32:49 (By Sofia Wu)

Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang should give priority to
the development of relations with Taiwan in a pragmatic manner so
as to upgrade the territory's intermediary role in engagements
across the Taiwan Strait, an official urged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman You Ying-lung made
the call after Tsang won another term in what the Economist
magazine called a "make-believe election" Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has actively developed ties with all sectors
of society in Hong Kong since the latter's return to China's fold
in 1997 after more than a century of British colonial rule, You
said the Hong Kong government has often snubbed Taiwan's
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
For fears of offending Beijing,  You said, the Hong Kong
government has imposed strict restrictions on visits to Taiwan by
its officials and repeatedly rejected Taiwan officials' visa
applications while delaying issuance of work permits for Taiwan
personnel posted in the territory or imposing unreasonable
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Given the brisk civilian exchanges and thriving trade between
Taiwan and Hong Kong, You said, the two sides need to cooperate
closely to offer better and more convenient services for their
citizens, particularly in emergency aid and legal assistance.
</P>
<P>
Following his latest election victory, You said, Tsang no longer
has any re- election pressure. "It is hoped that Tsang can grasp
this historic opportunity to pragmatically handle relations with
Taiwan and let Hong Kong serve as a useful conduit for cross-
strait engagements," You urged.
</P>
<P>
He also renewed Taiwan's call for the Hong Kong government to set
up a representative  office in Taipei to facilitate bilateral
exchanges, including offering faster relief services for Hong
Kong citizens in emergencies or disasters.
