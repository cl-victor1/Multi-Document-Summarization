WHIP

The Central Executive Committee of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will decide which polling format is to be
adopted at a meeting Wednesday, Wang Sing-nan, a DPP legislative
caucus whip, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after reports stated that a new polling
format was worked out by the Presidential Office which would
include the 70 percent of voters who are pro-green or swing
voters, while excluding that 30 percent who are staunch
supporters  of the Kuomintang, People First Party and New Party
pan-blue alliance.
</P>
<P>
Ten DPP Central Standing Committee members, including two DPP
presidential hopefuls -- Premier Su Tseng-chang and former
Premier Frank Hsieh -- are said to be in favor of the
Presidential Office's polling format.
</P>
<P>
Two other presidential aspirants -- Vice President Annette Lu and
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- were not among those who endorsed the
format. It is reported that they prefer a polling format that
includes only hard-core, pro-green voters, who comprise
approximately 40 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that the numbers of those in favor of President Chen's
polling format, and those who prefer including only hard-core
voters, are approximately the same, and the Central Executive
Committee members probably will have to vote on the matter to
decide which measure to embrace.
</P>
<P>
The polling format adopted will play a major role in deciding the
outcome of the DPP's presidential primary. According to the rules
governing the DPP's primary, public opinion surveys are weighed
70 percent while voting by party members accounts for the
remaining 30 percent of the poll to decide which hopeful will
become the DPP candidate.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Chen Chin-jun noted that President Chen's
intervention to work out a polling format is a positive
development, demonstrating that he is concerned about the party
winning the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-jun said that no matter what polling format is adopted,
the views of the four presidential aspirants should be respected.
</P>
<P>
If some hopefuls had not been consulted regarding their views,
there might well have been a serious division within the party,
which he said would not have contributed to party's unity.
</P>
<P>
Another DPP legislator, Gao Jyh-peng, a protege of President
Chen, said that the polling formats for the presidential and
legislative primaries are relevant, and President Chen wishes to
set the tone for the presidential primary so that others may
discuss rationally which polling format is to be adopted in the
legislative primaries.
</P>
<P>
A DPP legislator close to the president said that if President
Chen has not stepped in, then the final polling format might be
based on Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsin's proposal,
which would exclude only the 10 percent of deep-blue voters. Yang
belongs to the formerly powerful, now disbanded New Tide faction.
