MND TO REPORT ON INTELLIGENCE LEAKING CASE AFTER THOROUGH PROBE
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 11 (CNA) (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
National Defense Minister Lee Jye is taking very seriously the case of
alleged leaking of intelligence by a military officer, a Ministry of
National Defense (MND) spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Liu Chih-chien also said the minister will give a full
account of the case after a thorough investigation is carried out.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks after news reports said Chuang Po-hsin, a major
working in the MND's Communication Development Office (CDC) , passed
on secret national defense intelligence to a retired military officer
Huang Yao-Chung for the latter to turn over to China.
</P>
<P>
Huang has been arrested for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the MND has activated a damage control mechanism to review
the possible impact on national security in the wake of the incident.
</P>
<P>
CDC Director Lee Hsiang-chou noted that Maj. Chuang originally worked
in the CDC and that he was transferred to the MND's Intelligence
Division last year.
</P>
<P>
MND security personnel, working with prosecutors, searched Chuang's
house a day earlier. Initial investigations show that possible
intelligence passed on includes information on China's annual sea and
air military exercises, Lee said, adding that none of the intelligence
is related to secret codes for missiles, radar and communications as
stated in the news reports.
</P>
<P>
The CDC uses electronic signals to analyze the movements of the enemy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Chuang was transferred to the Intelligence Division for only a short
time, Lee noted. Chuang was only a low-ranking officer and therefore
didn't have access to top-secret information, he added.
