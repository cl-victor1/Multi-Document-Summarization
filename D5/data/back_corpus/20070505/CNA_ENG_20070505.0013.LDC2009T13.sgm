MANDATORY REGISTRATION FOR MARRIAGE TO TAKE EFFECT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  May 5 (CNA) 05/05/07  13:38:28 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Only marriages that are registered will be considered valid under
a newly passed package of amendments to the Civil Code, officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the package of amendments  which cleared the
legislative floor Friday, marriage must be authenticated in
written form, with both parties being required to register for
marriage in accordance with the Household Registration Law.
</P>
<P>
While registering  their marriage at household registration
offices, the married couple must also present the signatures of
more than two witnesses, according to the revised regulations.
</P>
<P>
The package of amendments to the Civil Code will take effect one
year after it is promulgated by the president. If all goes well,
the officials said, the new marriage rules will come into force
next May at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will usher in a significant change to the country's
marriage system. Under the existing law,  a marriage must be
celebrated by open ceremony in the presence of two or more
witnesses. As the "ceremonial marriage system" is prone to give
rise to disputes and is not very effective in preventing bigamy,
women's rights advocacy groups have long pushed for an overhaul
of the country's marriage system to install a "registration
marriage system."
</P>
<P>
The newly passed package also includes some other critical
revisions to the Civil Code, including assumption of family
names. Under the current law, a child assumes the surname of the
father unless it has been agreed that the child shall assume the
surname of the mother if the mother does not have any brothers.
</P>
<P>
The revised law stipulates that parents should record their
decision on the matter in written form before the birth of the
child. The new regulation has been formulated in line with the
principle of gender equality, the officials said.
