Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Acting Chairman Chai Trong-
rong and DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung urged party members
Saturday to cast their votes in Sunday's primaries for the
upcoming legislative and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Chai and Lin held a news conference Friday to call for party
members to vote in Saturday's polls and participate in signature
collecting drives for holding a national referendum on the issues
of retrieving the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) "ill-
gotten" assets and applying to join the United Nations under the
name of "Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The signature collecting activities will be held at polling
booths in each county and city Saturday, Chai said, adding that
only 150,000 more signatures need to be collected for the
petition to hold a national referendum on the KMT's "ill-gotten"
assets.

<P>
Lin said that information about every DPP candidate and their
political views have been printed in newspapers and that there
have even been TV ads by the various candidates that the
250,000-odd party members can use as a reference in deciding who
to vote for.
</P>
<P>
Lin said there will be a stricter voting process and ballot
supervision for Saturday's polls, and he reminded party members
to bring their identification cards and party membership cards
when they go to cast their ballots.
