Upgrading teacher quality is the key to success  in efforts to
promote the planned 12-year compulsory education system,
according to a consensus reached among participants in a forum
held by National Taiwan Normal University Saturday on the planned
system.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of scholars in education from around the country took part
in the forum, part of a series of forums on the 12-year
compulsory education plan adopted March 7 by the Executive Yuan
as one of its major national policies. The Executive Yuan has
allocated NT$40 billion (US$1.2 billion)  over three years
towards efforts to implement the system.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chin-shan, a professor at the Education Research Institute of
the Taipei Municipal University of Education, pointed out that
money is not the key factor in whether the 12-year compulsory
education system, set to implemented in 2009, will work or fail.
</P>
<P>
The most important factors will be how the students are enrolled
and how school districts are plotted out, as well as teacher
quality, Wu said, noting that a good teacher will directly affect
students' learning, and only good teachers can maintain a good
quality of national education.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, Wu said, currently, only one-
third of high school teachers hold master's or doctoral degrees,
while some 29 percent of teachers at vocational high schools hold
such degrees.
</P>
<P>
The ratio should be raised to 50 percent or more after the new
education system is implemented, Wu suggested.
</P>
<P>
The current teacher training programs must be upgraded amid the
approach of the implementation of the new system in order to
assist lecturers at high schools and vocational high schools in
adapting to the expected major changes to the existing school
curriculums, said Kao Hsun-fang,  dean of the College of
Education  at Tamkang University.
