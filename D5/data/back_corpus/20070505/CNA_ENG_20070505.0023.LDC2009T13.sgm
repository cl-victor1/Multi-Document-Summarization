Taiwan's high teenage pregnancy rate can be attributed to
insufficient sex education as well as the conservative attitude
of parents toward sex, an expert said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kao Sung-chin, secretary-general of the Taiwan Association for
Sexuality Education, made the remarks during a seminar sponsored
by the association.
</P>
<P>
Kao said that more open sex education, with teachers and parents
more willing to discuss issues related to sex, will be more
helpful to teenagers.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Taiwan's birth rate has continued to slip,
its birthrate among teenagers is the highest in Asia, or three
times that of Asia and five times that of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the birth rate among teenagers dropped to eight per
1,000 in 2005 from 14 per 1,000 in 2000, averaging 11.8 per 1,000
over the past five years. This compares with 4 per 1,000 in Japan
and 2.8 per 1,000 in South Korea.

<P>
Kao, also a director of academic affairs at a senior high school
in Taipei, said that an unofficial survey at his school found
that around two-thirds of students said they had not learned in
junior high school how to avoid becoming pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Kao noted that the sex industry in the Netherlands is famous but
that the country's birth rate among teenagers is the lowest among
European Union countries, pointing out that Dutch parents discuss
sex-related issues with their children over lunch when they are
as young as six.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Taiwan parents tend to be more conservative and
are more unwilling to discuss these issues with their children,
he added.
