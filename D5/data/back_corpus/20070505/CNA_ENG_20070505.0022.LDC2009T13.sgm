Taipei,  May  5 (CNA) 05/05/07  19:43:55 (By Ruth Wang)

<P>
Taiwan needs to normalize cross-strait economic relations by
lifting bans on imports of products from China, easing
restrictions on visits by Chinese tourists, and implementing
direct transport links in order to maintain its competitiveness,
the chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ralf Scheller made the remarks at the "2007 Europe Day Dinner"
held by the ECCT in Taipei City after President Chen Shui-bian
delivered aspeech at the event.

<P>
Taiwan has gradually become less competitive, indicated by the
fact that its economic growth rate last year was once again lower
than its Asian rivals, Scheller said, adding that Taiwan is
facing a choice  of "either  taking decisive  action towards
regaining international competitiveness or becoming
marginalized."
</P>
<P>
Scheller pointed out that Taiwan is surrounded by ambitious
countries, including Japan, South Korea, China, India, Vietnam
and Singapore, that are striving to upgrade their economic status
to that of a global service center, especially in the financial
services sector.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain Taiwan's competitiveness, the government
should also maintain an attractive tax environment and have a
transparent and stable regulatory system to attract more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Scheller called on all political parties in Taiwan to
ensure that their partisan interests do not prevail over
considerations of the country's economic development. He also
encouraged all parties to cooperate in transforming Taiwan into a
service-driven economy.
