Taipei, May 5 (CNA) The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment
Friday to the Employment Services Law to prohibit job
discrimination on the basis of three more categories -- age,
birth place and sexual orientation -- to better protect equal
employment opportunities, a Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the three items were added to the
current law that prohibits employers from discriminating against
any job applicant or employee on the basis of race, class,
language, thought, religion, political party, place of origin,
sex, marital status, appearance, facial features, disability, or
past membership in any labor union.
</P>
<P>
The CLA will promote enforcement of the newly amended law with
local governments and urge employers to focus on job seekers'
work experience and abilities, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, the official said, employers cannot use any
of the aforementioned items as restrictions in advertisements or
disclosures in personnel recruiting via any form of media.
Violators will face a fine of between NT$300,000 (US$8,900) and
NT$1.5 million
</P>
<P>
The amendment also reduces the waiting time from one year to six
months for employers to apply to replace a foreign domestic
worker who has absconded, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the amendment stipulates that an absconded foreign
worker's illegal employer, illegal broker, legal employer, and
the foreign worker himself or herself, have the responsibility,
in this order, to pay the repatriation costs and detention
expenses before the worker's departure from the country if the
worker has to be repatriated.
