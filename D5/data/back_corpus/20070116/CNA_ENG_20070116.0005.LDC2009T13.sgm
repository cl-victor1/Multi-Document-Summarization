Taipei,  Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  12:30:28 (By Sofia Wu)

<P>
Half-price ticket sales for the country's first high-speed
railway will be continued until the end of this month, a Taiwan
High Speed Rail Corp. (THSR) spokesman announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
THSR Chief Executive Officer Ou Chin-der said the extension of
the discounted ticket sales is his company's goodwill response to
public expectations as well as suggestions by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).
</P>
<P>
The company began its bullet train service between Banciao Taipei
County and Zuoying, Kaohsiung County Jan. 5. The discount fares
were originally scheduled to end Jan. 14 but were later extended
to Jan. 19 due to some embarrassing technical glitches,
particularly with the ticketing system. As the situation has not
yet improved to a "perfect state," the company has decided to
prolong the "commercial test runs" until Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
Half-price tickets for trips from Jan. 20-31 will go on sale Jan.
17, Ou said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ou said the company has filed an application with the
MOTC for field inspection of the system's final 5-kilometer
section linking Banciao with Taipei City.
</P>
<P>
According to Ou, the company has secured unconditional safety
certification of the authoritative British certifying
organization Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) .
Nevertheless, he said, the company will not start "commercial
test runs" for the Banciao-Taipei  section  until after the MOTC
completes  field inspection and testing.
</P>
<P>
Pang Chia-hua, director of the MOTC's Bureau of High Speed Rail,
said the bureau has selected engineering experts for field
inspection of the high-speed rail's final section. The field
survey aimed at detecting the system's possible flaws or
deficiencies will cover three areas -- civil engineering,
electric engineering and software operations.
</P>
<P>
"A timetable for the field inspection will be worked out after we
receive all relevant documents from THSR, " Pang said, adding
that he hopes the field inspection can be finalized by the end of
January so that the section can be opened for commercial
operations during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday which
will begin on New Year's Eve on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
The 345-kilometer rail system cuts travel time between Taipei and
the southern port city of Kaohsiung from four-and-half-hours to
90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan's transportation
committee Monday, MOTC Vice Minister Ho Nuan-hsuan said the
NT$480 billion project represents arduous efforts to provide
state of the art transportation solutions for the benefit of the
country's 23 million people, while saving energy and preserving
the environment.
</P>
<P>
As to some technical glitches during the system's first 10 days
of "commercial test runs, " Ho said they mainly involved software
or ticketing operations rather than safety problems.
</P>
<P>
Responding to lawmakers' complaints that the MOTC has so far not
slapped THSR with any fines despite its many operational flaws,
including delays, overbooking, and unidentified fumes escaping in
a carriage, Ho said the MOTC will definitely fulfill its duty of
overseeing bullet train operations to ensure traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ho said there is currently no law giving the MOTC
the right to fine THSR management for its operational glitches or
flaws. "Anyway, the MOTC will draft penalty rules as soon as
possible, " he promised.
