Taipei, Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  19:01:20 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

<P>
The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) announced Tuesday
that it will cut the price of gasoline by NT$0.6 per liter and
that of diesel oil by NT$0.7. The new prices will become
effective from the first hour of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The price adjustment reflects a fall in international crude oil
prices due to a dropping demand, the CPC said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC began Jan. 3 to implement a floating price system for oil
to better reflect the company's costs.
</P>
<P>
The new floating pricing system is built based on fluctuations in
the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
