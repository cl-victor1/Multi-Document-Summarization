Taipei, Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  20:57:54 (By Lilian Wu)

An official in charge of China policy urged the Chinese
government to start consultations with Taiwan on many priority
issues soon, claiming that a window of opportunity for such talks
will open before July.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Tung Cheng-yuan made the remarks during a
seminar on cross- Taiwan Strait trade exchanges in 2007, which
was sponsored by the Department of Chinese Affairs of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
Although Tung did not elaborate on his July timing claim, there
have been suggestions that up until that month will offer the
best chance for cross-strait talks, as Taiwan will be preoccupied
after that with the legislative election in the latter half of
the year and the 2008 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the government hopes to push for talks on full opening
to Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan, as well as on issues
regarding charter flight services.
</P>
<P>
Other priority issues include selling Taiwan agricultural produce
to China, a cross-strait currency clearance and liquidation
agreement, a cross-strait financial supervisory mechanism, cross-
strait intellectual property rights protection, judicial
assistance and cooperation in fighting crime, as well as
protection on the investment of Taiwan businessmen operating in
China.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government's guiding principle regarding cross-
strait trade policy will continue to be the "active management
and effective opening" espoused by President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
Tamkang University Professor Chang Wu-yueh said that judging from
the remarks of the leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, it
will be difficult for the two sides to make a breakthrough on
political issues this year.
