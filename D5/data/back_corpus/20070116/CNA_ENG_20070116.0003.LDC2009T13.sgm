NO TIMETABLE FOR RESUMPTION OF CANADIAN BEEF IMPORTS: DOH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 16 (CNA) 01/16/07  12:17:07 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
No timetable has been set for a resumption of Canadian beef
imports, a senior Department of Health (DOH) official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shu-kung, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said while
meeting with a Canadian parliamentary delegation a day earlier
that DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mou will travel to Canada later this
month to assess whether to reopen Taiwan's doors to Canadian
beef.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hou's visit is only part of the normal procedure in
evaluating whether to resume imports of Canadian beef, Chen said
Hou's travel plan does not signal an imminent lifting of the
import ban.
</P>
<P>
"No decisive move will be taken until after a careful review of
Canada's related inspection  and quarantine  measures for beef
exports," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Before deciding to resume U.S. beef imports last year, Chen said,
the DOH had also sent an expert delegation to the United States
to gauge the feasibility of removing the import ban.
</P>
<P>
"The only difference will be that the expert delegation to Canada
will be headed by our health minister to underscore the
importance we have attached to the study tour, while the previous
delegation for the U.S. inspection tour was headed by another
official, " Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has banned imports of Canadian beef since the discovery of
a case of mad cow disease in Canada in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Hou's mission will be to visit major Canadian cattle
ranches, feed factories, processing plants and slaughterhouses to
review Canada's overall inspection, quarantine,  sanitation and
quality control operations.
</P>
<P>
"The findings will serve as reference in determining whether to
lift the import ban, " Chen said, adding that a series of review
meetings will be held after the delegation's return to make a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan used to be the fifth-largest market for Canadian beef.
During his meeting with a group of visiting Canadian
parliamentarians Monday, President Chen said Canadian agriculture
has suffered a severe blow since several countries, including
Taiwan, Japan and China, banned Canadian beef imports in the wake
of a case of mad cow disease in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Japan's recent resumption of Canadian beef
imports, President Chen said, Taiwan's health minister will head
an expert mission to visit Canada later this month to assess
whether to follow suit.
