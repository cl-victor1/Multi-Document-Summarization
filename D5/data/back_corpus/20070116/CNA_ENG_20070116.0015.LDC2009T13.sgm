Taiwan's military exchanges with other countries are based on the
principle of not tipping regional military balances, the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh was responding to reports that
light weapons produced in Taiwan were offered to several of the
country's diplomatic allies, including Liberia, Paraguay, Haiti
and Nicaragua, and then used in blood civil conflicts following
changes in regimes in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Wang dismissed the reports as untrue, saying that military
exchanges are part of Taiwan's overall diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan has adopted a "cautious" and "restrained"
approach regarding military exchanges, saying that the exchanges
are carefully monitored to prevent the possibility of tipping
regional military balances of power.
</P>
<P>
The military exchanges cover a wide number of areas, he said,
noting that Taiwan is currently helping its Central and Southern
American allies train military officers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has also provided a limited number of military items to
them, including such things as helmets and gas masks, he said.
