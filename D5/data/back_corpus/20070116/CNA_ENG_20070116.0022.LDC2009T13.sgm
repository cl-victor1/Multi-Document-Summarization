POTENTIAL RIVAL ASKS FOR CHANCE IN KMT'S PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  16 (CNA) 01/16/07  17:59:07 (By Flor Wang)
</P>
<P>
A potential rival hoping to challenge Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou's bid for candidacy in the party's presidential
primary urged the KMT Tuesday not to boycott his participation in
the primaries.
</P>
<P>
Hwang Kwang-kuo, a professor at National Taiwan University who
also serves as convener of the Democratic Act Alliance, told a
news conference at the Legislative Yuan that the KMT should back
date his application for renewing his party membership to Dec. 8
last year so as to qualify him to take part in the presidential
primaries.
</P>
<P>
The KMT held a party affairs meeting with department directors
Monday and has initially slated the presidential primary to be
held April 15.
</P>
<P>
As KMT regulations require that a party member must have joined
the KMT at least four months before being eligible to apply to
compete in the presidential primary, Hwang argued that the KMT
should reinstate his party membership soon to allow him to
compete in the primary against Ma.
</P>
<P>
In response to a claim by Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT's
Organization Development Commission, that a KMT member must also
have once served as convener of a voting station to qualify for
participation in the party's presidential primary, Hwang
questioned the meaning of the point and encouraged the KMT not to
resort to such a tactic to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
"Members of Ma's team must not employ a technical boycott to
force me stay out of the presidential primary, " Hwang said,
adding that "Ma must be able to withstand challenges from
others."
</P>
<P>
Hwang called on Ma's aides to study his theories set forth for
building a bright future for the party and the nation, and urged
them to encourage Ma to debate with him.
</P>
<P>
If Ma's aides fail to do so, this would not help Ma but in turn
would hurt Taiwan's people, Hwang claimed, warning that he might
make moves against the KMT in that case.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile,  Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,  a KMT
stalwart, opined that the party should provide the public and
personnel involved with more time and more information before it
decides when to hold the party's presidential primary and whom to
nominate.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks after it was reported earlier the same day
that the KMT has set April 15 to hold the presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
To field a presidential candidate is a very significant matter
for any political party and its candidate must be fully qualified
and display leadership ability to the rest of the country, Wang
said. Asked by reporters whether he will take part in the KMT's
primary to select its candidate in the 2008 presidential
election, Wang was reserved and said only that the rules of the
game are not yet in place.
</P>
<P>
While Ma has been widely viewed as the opposition "pan-blue
alliance's" best bet for the 2008 presidential election, Wang is
also a KMT heavyweight who wields some influence in the party and
is considered by some supporters as an adequate hopeful in the
next presidential race.
