The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) signed a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) with British Financial Service Authority
(FSA)  Tuesday on cooperation in financial supervision,
information exchanges and assistance in probes into financial
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that the Cabinet-level commission has
forged cooperative ties with a similar foreign financial
supervisory body.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the accord, the two sides will strengthen
cooperation  in financial supervision  and investigations  into
suspected financial irregularities or crimes, FSC officials said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that London is one of the world's foremost financial
capitals, the officials said six Taiwanese banks have either
opened liaison offices or branches. Three British banks -- the
Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Standard Chartered Bank and
Barclays Bank -- have also maintained branches in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
FSC officials said the FSC-FSA cooperative pact is of great
significance as it can not only provide a formal channel for
Taiwan-British cooperation in fianncial supervision but also
symbolizes the maturity of Taiwan's financial supervisory system.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of the MOU embodies that our financial supervisory
norms, principles and operational rules have lived up to the
international standards," said an FSC official.
