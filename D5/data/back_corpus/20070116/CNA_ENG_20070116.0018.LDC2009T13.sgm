WHO URGED TO HANDLE TAIWAN'S BID UNDER MEDIAL ETHICS

A medical professionals leader from Taiwan urged World Health
Organization Director-General Margaret Chan to deal with Taiwan's
bid to gain observer status in the health entity under the
principles of medical ethics.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shu-min, chairman of the board of directors of the Foundation
of Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan, who is currently on
a lobbying tour of Europe for Taiwan's WHO bid, made the appeal
prior to the opening of the WHO Executive Commission.
</P>
<P>
"As a doctor-turned WHO director-general, Chan has her own
professional ethics," Wu said, voicing the hope that Chan will
adhere to medical ethics while dealing with Taiwan's WHO entry
bid.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wu said, when a professional is confronted by
political considerations,  his or her professionalism  may be
disregarded; therefore, Taiwan should not harbor high
expectations with regards to Chan, who was appointed WHO
director-general in November 2006.
</P>
<P>
Wu and his delegation members are scheduled to meet with
representatives from several major Paris-based media
organizations such as Humanite and Politique Internationale to
drum up support for Taiwan's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has sought to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an
observer since 1997. Because of China's obstruction, Taiwan has
seen little progress in its bid. At last year's WHA gathering,
Taiwan's hopes of joining  the organization were dashed for the
10th consecutive year when the WHA General Committee decided not
to include Taiwan's bid on the assembly's agenda.
