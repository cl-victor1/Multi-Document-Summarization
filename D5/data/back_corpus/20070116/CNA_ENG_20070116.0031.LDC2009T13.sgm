NAMES OF BANK LOAN DEFAULTERS SHOULD BE PUBLISHED: DPP CAUCUS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  16 (CNA) 01/16/07  20:19:47 (By Luis Huang)

<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) called Tuesday for the Executive Yuan to publish the names
of individuals or firms that have outstanding loans owed to the
Chinese Bank and other banks that have been taken over by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Yi-jin, chief convener of the DPP legislative caucus, said at
a news conference that major loan defaulters should be "named and
shamed"  in accordance  with  the  Regulations  Governing  the
Establishment and Management of the Financial Reconstruction
Fund, no matter whether a draft amendment to the Banking Law
clears the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yeh made  the remarks  after  the Cabinet-level  Financial
Supervisory Commission (FSC) published the banks' internal loan
application code numbers of those who have failed to pay off bank
loans at a closed-door meeting called by the legislature's
Finance Committee a day earlier to discuss a revision to the
Banking Law that would allow the government to publish the names
of major loan defaulters in a bid to clamp down on financial
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
It is hard for the FSC to win public confidence in its
determination to crack down on financial irregularities by
publishing only defaulters' codes, since the public cannot tell
whether there has been collusion between loan applicants and
banks or not, according to Yeh.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the public has the "right to know" the names of
loan delinquents, Yeh said it is regrettable that many
legislators have boycotted the draft amendment to the Banking Law
in secret, while expressing support for the revision in public.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Yeh said, the DPP caucus insists that the FSC should
publish the names of individuals or firms with bad loans of more
than NT$1 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Yu Cheng-tao said that the Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank has written off bad loans worth around NT$21.11
billion, followed by NT$17.31 billion written off by the Mega
International Commercial Bank and NT$10.95 billion by the Cathay
United Bank.
</P>
<P>
Yu called on lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang to
support the early passage of the draft amendment to the Banking
Law.
