Nearly 20,000 passengers have traveled between Taiwan and China
via the outlying island of Kinmen for the Chinese New Year
holiday over the last eight days leading up to and including
Saturday, according to officials from the Kinmen Harbor
Authority.
</P>
<P>
The small Taiwan-held island saw 571 inbound travelers and 373
outbound travelers Saturday. Ferries will not operate Sunday on
Chinese New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Most of the inbound passengers Saturday were Taiwan businessmen
working in China. They made a transit stop in Kinmen before
flying on to Taiwan. The outbound passengers were mainly China-
born spouses of Taiwan nationals  heading back to their hometowns
or Taiwan businessmen assigned to work in China during the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Although the ferry service was operating smoothly Saturday, the
island's only airport was closed for an hour in the morning
because of heavy fog, and a flight from Taiwan carrying some 200
passengers wanting to head on to Xiamen by ferry arrived about an
hour late. As a result, the departure time of Saturday's last
ferry to Xiamen, originally scheduled for 11 a.m., was delayed
for fifty minutes to wait for the passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Kinmen Harbor Authority, which operates the ferry services
between the outlying island and Xiamen and Chuanzhou in Fujian
Province in southern China, began adding extra ferry service
eight days ago to handle the increased passenger traffic ahead of
the holidays. As of the end of Saturday, a total of 19,138 people
had used the ferry service during the eight-day period, marking
an increase of 2,184 passengers over the figure for the same
period last year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ferry service will resume Monday, when many local residents are
expected to travel to China for sightseeing during the weeklong
Lunar New Year holiday and Taiwan businessmen will begin to
return to their posts in China following the holiday.
