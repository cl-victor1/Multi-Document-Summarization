President Chen Shui-bian extended his Lunar New Year greetings to
his fellow compatriots in a short videotape Saturday, wishing
them a happy New Year's Day.

The one minute and 52 second long video tape is a montage
consisting of footage of the country's two female tenis players
who won the second place in the women's double at the 2006
Australian Open tenis championship, an engineer standing in front
of the Hsueshan Tunnel on the freeway linking Yilan and Taipei, a
train running on the island's high speed railway, and a farmer
whose rise won the top prize in a islandwide competition.

By playing these images of the country's glorious moments, the
president said the outgoing year is a fruitful one thanks to the
hard work of all people, and the coming year is sure to be more
brilliant as long as the people keep working hard.
