E-PASSPORT STILL UNDER STUDY: VICE FOREIGN MINISTER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 15 (CNA) 01/15/07  15:50:47 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is indeed planning to
issue electronic passports, but the matter is still under study,
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Yang Tze-pao said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yang was responding to reports that e-passports, which store
personal information on a tiny radio frequency identification
(RFID) computer chip, will begin to be issued by the end of this
year at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that in keeping with the world trend, the ministry is
indeed planning to issue biometric passports in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, as there are still some concerns regarding possible
privacy infringements as well as certain technical problems to
work out, the government is still studying the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "human rights violations will be a major concern
in issuing the e-passport."
</P>
<P>
Noting that a full year will be required to study the matter, he
said the new passports "may be issued from next year."
</P>
<P>
Public reaction will also be taken into consideration, he said.
The ministry will also study the matter with the Executive Yuan,
adding that there is still "no specific timetable."
</P>
<P>
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh echoed Yang's words, saying that
issuing electronic passports is in keeping with the world trend.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the personal information stored on the e-passport's
chip will be the same as the information contained in the current
passport. The chip in the e-passport will contain a photograph of
the holder, but no fingerprint or iris pattern, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang cited statistics as showing that currently, nearly 5 million
Taiwanese people use their passports for traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 35 countries that issue e-passports, Wang
said, stressing that it is a world trend and that the e-passport
will be more effective in dealing with fraud or forgery.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) noted that whether e-passports are issued depends on
whether the legislature passes an amendment to the passport
statute proposed by the MOFA and its related budget.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said the fact that the e-passport will only contain the
personal information that is found on the current passport and
not contain the holder's fingerprints or iris pattern should make
it acceptable to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Justin S. Chou said that
no country can guarantee that e-passports will not be forged
given the advances in technology and that there are indeed
concerns regarding human rights.
</P>
<P>
The party will not support the amendment to the passport statute
until the MOFA can ensure that all the information stored on the
e-passport will be safe, Chou said.
