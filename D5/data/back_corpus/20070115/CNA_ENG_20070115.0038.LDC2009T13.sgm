Taipei, Jan.15 (CNA) 01/15/07  21:51:41 (By Elizabeth Hsu)

Taiwan ought to strengthen its efforts to improve trade and
investment relations with members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) as leaders of the ASEAN states have
recently reconfirmed a proposal to build a free trade zone in the
region by 2015, said Council of Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 12th ASEAN Summit took place Jan.13-15 in Cebu City, the
Philippines. During the event various bilateral leadership
meetings between ASEAN and non-ASEAN countries were also
conducted, as well as an East Asian summit attended by regional
powers, including China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to efforts exerted at this event, and in the face of
the upcoming formation of the regional economic bloc, Taiwan
should try to develop and promote the formation of more
strategic, cooperative economic ties with countries around the
globe, the CEPD suggested.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan should also work harder to promote the forging of free
trade agreements or other similar accords with economies like
those of Japan and the United States in an effort to preserve a
space in the international community, despite strong pressure
from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEPD, the draft of the ASEAN charter was passed
Jan. 13 during the Cebu Summit, and is scheduled to be confirmed
at the 13th Summit slated for November.
</P>
<P>
The planned charter is aimed at turning the regional organization
into a legal entity like the European Union, the CEPD said,
noting it was prepared for the ASEAN to turn into an "East Asian
Common Market."
