PREMIER HOPING FOR U.S. JUDICIAL AID OVER REBAR HEAD APPREHENSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 15 (CNA) 01/15/07  18:07:12 (By Deborah Kuo)
</P>
<P>
Premier Su Tseng-chang asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) Monday to probe the feasibility of asking the U.S.
government for judicial aid in the apprehension or repatriation
of the founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group.
</P>
<P>
After MOFA officials confirmed Monday that Rebar founder Wang
You-theng and his fourth wife, Chin Shih-ying, had gone on the
run to the United States, Su instructed the officials to
negotiate with their counterparts at the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office for possible U.S. judicial assistance
in the apprehension of Wang and Chin, who had first fled to China
in late December before escaping to the United States.
</P>
<P>
MOFA officials confirmed that the couple entered the United
States via San Francisco Saturday, with Wang using a Republic of
China passport and Chin using a U.S. passport.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office formally issued wanted
notices for the arrest of Wang and Chin Monday on charges of
embezzlement, insider trading and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Prosecutor Lin Chin-tsun said the orders for the arrest
of the couple will remain effective until May 2031.
</P>
<P>
Two subsidiaries of the Rebar Group, which consists of 120-odd
subsidiaries, applied for insolvency protection Dec. 29, and Wang
and his wife reportedly fled to China Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
The insolvency reorganization announcement of the two Rebar
subsidiaries -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic
Fiber Co. -- prompted a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar
affiliate, which lost NT$32 billion (US$977.3 million) in
deposits in three days.
</P>
<P>
The bank run led to the exposure of the Rebar financial chaos,
which has triggered a domestic financial storm.
</P>
<P>
The investigators searched Chin Shih-ying's office at the Chinese
Bank last week and seized more than 10 boxes of documents as
evidence unfavorable to the Wang couple and those who stand
accused in the Rebar scandal.
</P>
<P>
Early investigation results also prompted a decision by the
Taipei Prosecutor's Office last Friday to prohibit a total of 48
Rebar group executives and Wang family members from leaving
Taiwan. The charges include breach of trust, forgery, fraud,
insider trading, embezzlement of corporate funds and violations
of the banking law and accounting regulations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lin declined to confirm Monday whether Gary Wang, one
of the founder's sons who heads Eastern Multimedia Group, is
included on the list of executives prohibited from leaving the
country. Gary Wang has said his group is a separate company and
has denied involvement in any Rebar-related scandals.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's chief financial regulator, Shih Jun-ji, who is chairman
of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), resigned Friday
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Rebar group employs more than 5,000 people, many of whom have
joined forces to organize a self-help association aimed at
protecting their rights, an association spokesman said.
