Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu arrived in the northwestern Italian city
of Turin Sunday to bid for the right to host the 2011 Summer
Universiade in the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
It is the city's third attempt to obtain the hosting right for
the sports event, also called the World University Games,
organized for university athletes by the International University
Sports Federation (FISU). Kaohsiung failed in its previous two
bids.
</P>
<P>
The bid has the support of the central government and the Chinese
Taipei University Sports Federation, Chen said upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
There are other four cities competing with Kaohsiung for the
hosting right -- Shenzhen in China, Kazan in Russia, Poznan in
Poland and Murcia in Spain. The FISU is scheduled to decide the
2011 host Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng and Chen Chuan-shou, minister
of the National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, also
arrived in Turin that same day to help Kaohsiung win the chance
to host another big international sports event after it was
selected to organize the 2009 World Games.
</P>
<P>
Chen is scheduled to return home Jan. 18 after attending the 2007
Winter Universiade's Jan. 17 opening ceremony.
