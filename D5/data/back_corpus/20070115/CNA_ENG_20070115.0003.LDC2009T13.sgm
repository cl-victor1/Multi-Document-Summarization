CDC SEES NO NEED TO HEIGHTEN BIRD FLU ALERT FOR NOW

There is no need for Taiwan to stiffen its precautionary measures
against avian influenza for the time being since no suspected
case has been reported so far, an official from the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi made the remarks amid reports of
human infection of bird flu virus in Indonesia and China and bird
flu outbreaks among poultry in Japan and Vietnam in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Quoting monitoring data, Shih said Taiwan doesn't face an
increased threat of avian flu outbreaks at the moment, despite
reports of new human casualties and poultry outbreaks in
neighboring Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In 2006, Shih said, 99 suspected avian influenza cases were
reported to the CDC, but none of them were confirmed as infection
of any strain of bird flu virus.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Shih said, no suspected case
has been reported, not to mention a confirmed one.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shih said, the government has focused its bird flu
prevention campaign at the country's main gateways -- airports
and harbors -- as well as on surveillance of wild bird migration.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Shih said, the CDC has long stepped up fever
screening on incoming passengers at airports and harbors, in
addition to requiring all passengers from countries where human
bird flu infections have been reported, such as China, Indonesia
and Vietnam, to undergo a 10-day self-health management. During
the period, passengers should keep vigilant about their own
health conditions.
</P>
<P>
As to preparations for epidemic control, Shih said the CDC has
stockpiled more than 100,000 doses of avian flu vaccines which
will be sufficient to inoculate over 90,000 individuals. The
stocks of anti-avian flu drugs are also sufficient for use of 2.3
million people or 10 percent of the country's total population,
Shih said, adding that the CDC will adjust the amount of its
vaccine and antivirus drugs in terms of the global epidemic
situation.
</P>
<P>
With a warm winter, Shih said, the number of migratory birds from
the notrth to overwinter in Taiwan has declined this season,
curtailing the chances of spreading virulent H5N1 bird flu strain
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Shih said, rampant poultry smuggling across the
Taiwan Strait still poses a potential threat. Starting this year,
he went on, the CDC will give priority to public health education
as part of its effort to raise ordinary people's awarness of
health hazards of live animal smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, Hong Kong and Japan have reported bird flu outbreaks
this month, while Indonesian officials said four people died
recently from the virulent H5N1 virus. Myanmar reported its first
H5N1 outbreak in chickens and quails in early March at farms in
central Myanmar.  Bird flu killed 42 of the 93 people infected in
Vietnam in 2003-2005.
</P>
<P>
It has killed 161 people globally since 2003, according to the
World Health Organisation, spreading from Asia to Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Bird flu does not easily infect humans and has so far killed 161
people worldwide since 2003, a relatively small number compared
to many diseases. But epidemiologists fear H5N1 virus could
trigger a global pandemic if it were to mutate and become easily
transmitted among humans.
