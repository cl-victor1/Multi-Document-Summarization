Taiwan scored a major victory in its efforts to find new markets
for agricultural exports with South Korea agreeing to open the
door to poultry products from four Taiwanese food processors, a
Council of Agriculture spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The council began to negotiate with its South Korean counterpart
through Taiwan's representative office in Seoul for poultry
product exports last May, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In the course of months of negotiations, South Korea unveiled
health regulations concerning the import of Taiwanese poultry
products last November, and sent food safety officials to Taiwan
for field surveys in December.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with the quality control measures and facilities of
four Taiwanese poultry product companies, South Korea announced
earlier this month that these four companies may commence
exporting poultry products to its market.
</P>
<P>
According to COA officials, the largest market for Taiwanese
poultry products is Japan, which imported 5,100 tons last year
worth about NT$1.2 billion. With South Korea opening its door,
the officials said, local poultry products manufacturers will
enjoy an increase in their revenues.
