Taiwan's state-run China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSC) announced
Monday its 2007 goal of increasing its annual operating income to
NT$24.4 billion from last year's NT$19.8 billion and the total
tonnage of ships built from 120,000 to 180,000.
</P>
<P>
The CSC earned revenues of NT$19.8 billion in 2006, NT$800
million higher than legal budget income, with a NT$1.492 billion
pretax surplus -- NT$1.153 billion higher than the standard set
by the government, according to the Kaohsiung-based company. It
also said it should be able to fulfill the government requirement
of making a pretax surplus of not less than NT$1.203 billion in
2007.

CSC Board Chairman Frank Lu thanked the staff of the company at
an internal meeting that day, saying that the CSC in the last
year has managed to improve and speed up manufacturing processes,
increase efficiency and bring down costs despite price hikes in
raw materials and fierce international competition.
</P>
<P>
Lu said a continuous growth in demand for ships is expected in
2007, although a vast expansion in the shipbuilding capacities of
developing  countries nevertheless  has raised  concern  about
overproduction.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the global challenge in the coming year, the CSC
is making efforts to develop competitive ship types, to expand
its market using its combined advantages in design and
technology, and to reduce overall costs by further shortening the
shipbuilding duration by one to two months, Lu said.
