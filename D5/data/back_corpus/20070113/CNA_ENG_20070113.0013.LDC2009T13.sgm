PROSECUTORS SEARCH REBAR GROUP HEADQUARTERS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Taipei,  Jan. 13 (CNA) 01/13/07  15:19:17 (By Sofia Wu)
</P>
<P>
Investigators have seized more useful data in their second search
of the troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group headquarters in
connection with a probe into the group's suspected involvement
in insider trading,  prosecution authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A team headed by Prosecutor Chang Shu-hua searched 17 locations,
including the Rebar Group headquarters and the homes of the
group's board members a day earlier, focusing on accounting and
transaction records related to suspected insider trading of
shares of two ailing Rebar affiliates -- China Rebar Co. and Chia
Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-tsun, spokesman for the Taipei Prosecutor's Office, said
investigators confiscated 40 boxes of documents, including some
"very helpful" data.
</P>
<P>
"The impounded items include computer discs, private notebooks,
accounting books and transaction records that will be very
helpful with the investigation into the Rebar Group's suspected
illegal commercial dealings," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The search followed Thursday's massive raid at more than 30
locations, including China Rebar Co. Chairwoman Wang-Chin Shih-
ying's office at the Kuangfu branch of another of the group's
subsidiaries -- the Chinese Bank.
</P>
<P>
Investigators seized accounting books and notebooks they said
contain new evidence linked to insider trading of shares of more
than four of the group's subsidiaries, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"Friday's search has spurred investigators into believing that
the group's founder, Wang You-theng, had long been deliberating
hollowing out the corporate assets, " Lin said, adding that Wang
had regularly met with the group's six top financial executives
to discuss how to embezzle various Rebar affiliates' funds
through cross holding and insider trading.
</P>
<P>
Judicial probes were launched after China Rebar and Chia Hsin
applied for insolvency reorganization last Thursday after
suffering losses totaling more than NT$25.2 billion over the past
seven years. Their move triggered a run on the Chinese Bank the
following day.
</P>
<P>
The investigations initially focused on suspected irregularities
of five Rebar subsidiaries -- the Great Chinese Bills Finance
Corp.'s suspected  provision of questionable  financing to other
Rebar affiliates, Union Insurance Co.'s illegal lending, the
Chinese Bank's excessive lending and insider trading involving
China Rebar and Chia Hsin shares.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, two Union Insurance executives -- Vice Chairman
Wang Ling-yi and President Wang Shih-chan -- had been taken into
custody pending further investigations, while Union Chairman Chin
Shih-ho had been released on NT$200,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the probes may be expanded following the searches
in the past two days, Lin said, adding that investigators will
examine the data and records seized before deciding their next
step.
</P>
<P>
The group's 82-year-old founder Wang You-theng fled to China Dec.
30 and his fourth wife, Wang-Chin Shih-ying, also sneaked into
China Jan. 1, only a few days before prosecutors prohibited
scores of their family members and Rebar executives from leaving
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Bank crisis eased only after the government asked the
Central Deposit Insurance Corp. to take over the failing bank and
used the Financial Reconstruction Fund to cope with the fiasco.
