DPP LAWMAKERS WANT TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC FUGITIVES REPATRIATED FROM
CHINA
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan.  12  (CNA) 01/13/07  12:04:37 (By Han Nai-kuo)

<P>
The government should negotiate with Chinese authorities to have
Taiwanese economic fugitives repatriated from China to face
justice, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged Friday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Kao Chih-peng told a press conference that China has
become a paradise for Taiwanese economic fugitives, now that 11
major economic criminals have fled Taiwan to take residence
there.
</P>
<P>
The latest arrival in the fugitive club is Wang You-theng, the 82
-year-old founder and chairman of the financially distressed
Rebar Asia-Pacific Group who fled with his wife at the end of
last year and left behind large debts possibly running as high as
NT$100 billion, Kao noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang left Taiwan as soon as two major subsidiaries of Rebar Asia-
Pacific Group -- China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic
Fiber Co. -- filed for bankruptcy protection. One of Wang's sons
has confirmed that his father made it clear he would never come
back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economic criminals in China also include fugitive tycoon
Chen Yu-hao, a former Tuntex Group chairman, who was indicted for
embezzling more than NT$800 million from Tung Hua Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
Kao said Taiwan and China should work out a mechanism to
repatriate each other's economic criminals, and that the
government should negotiate with Chinese authorities immediately.
</P>
<P>
"If China fails to demonstrate sincerity in this regard, Taiwan
should put a hold on all measures that would relax control on
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, including allowing Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Kao's call, DPP Legislator Kuo Cheng-liang said the 11
economic fugitives have been allowed to live in China because
they have invested their illegal gains there and used their
financial strength to curry favor with Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Kuo urged Premier Su Tseng-chang to face the issue squarely and
even go so far as ceasing cross-strait  contacts  if Chinese
authorities refuse to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
DPP  Legislator  Hung  Chi-chang,  however,  urged  careful
consideration before making any decisions. He pointed out that
Taiwan's domestic demand accounted for only one-fourth of
Taiwan's economic growth last year, and that banning Chinese
tourists from visiting Taiwan would not be beneficial to Taiwan's
economy.
