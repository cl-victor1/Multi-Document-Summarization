<P>
President Chen Shui-bian returned to Taiwan Saturday morning from
a visit to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Chen originally planned to return Friday night, but his schedule
was delayed for five hours because Mexico rescinded its
permission for his plane to fly through its flight information
region under pressure from China, forcing the plane to make a
detour around Mexican airspace on its way from Nicaragua to Los
Angeles for a brief transit stop.
</P>
<P>
Chen visited Nicaragua Jan. 9-11 to attend the inauguration of
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega via San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
During his 16-hour overnight transit stop in San Francisco, the
president met with American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond
Burghardt and former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, and
exchanged views with key U.S. Congress members by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Chen also had a 40-minute telephone dialogue with top Washington
officials, which he described as "the best ever" in the past
several years.
