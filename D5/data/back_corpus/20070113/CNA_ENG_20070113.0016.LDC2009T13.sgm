</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  Jan. 13 (CNA) 01/13/07  17:01:09 (By Lilian Wu)

<P>
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) officials said Saturday that the
passage of an amendment to the Senior Citizen's Welfare Law will
help facilitate government's efforts to take care of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
MOI officials said the amended law, which passed the Legislative
Yuan a day earlier, has adopted many new concepts and preventive
measures. The law, which was first promulgated in January 1980,
has not been comprehensively revised over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
They cited as examples that the amended law contains provisions
that employers cannot discriminate against elderly employees and
that the government can file for interdiction on behalf of the
elderly to ensure property safety.
</P>
<P>
The government must also conduct a census on the living
conditions of the elderly at least every five years and set up
service facilities for the elderly, they said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that private nursing homes that do not take good care of
the elderly can pose risks, the amended law also stipulates that
such institutes have to sign written contracts with the elderly
or their family members to clearly define their obligations in
order to prevent later disputes, they said.
</P>
<P>
If nursing homes abuse their charges, withhold information on the
abuse, provide an unsafe environment or unsanitary food, they
will face fines of between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 (US$1,830-US$
9,150) and will be fined continuously if the situation is not
improved.
</P>
<P>
If the nursing homes hurt or abandon the elderly, they will be
fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000 and their names will be
published, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to MOI statistics, the population of senior citizens in
Taiwan had reached 2,287,029, or around 10 percent of the total
population, as of the end of December.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, the ratio will have increased to 20 percent by 2026.
The speed of the graying of Taiwan will be only second to Japan,
making the revisions to the Senior Citizen's Welfare Law
necessary, the officials said.
