KRTC TO RECRUIT LOCAL WORKERS TO COPE WITH LABOR SHORTAGE

Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) said Saturday that it is
recruiting local and aboriginal workers to cope with a labor
shortage problem.
</P>
<P>
KRTC officials said the construction of the Red Line of the mass
rapid transit system in the southern port city, affected by
several cave-in accidents in late 2005, is lagging behind
schedule, but that the Orange Line should be completed on
schedule this October.
</P>
<P>
With only 685 Thai workers left working on the system, the
officials said they cannot cope with the accelerated construction
work and will seek local laborers Jan. 15 to fill 100 job
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, major contractors have sent scouts to Hualien and
Taitung in eastern Taiwan to recruit aboriginal people.
</P>
<P>
KRTC began to recruit Thai workers in 2003 to assist in
underground boring work. The number of Thai nationals working for
the KRTC project reached a peak of 1,717 at one point, but the
number has gradually declined since August 2005, when a group of
Thai workers rioted in protest over the inhumane treatment they
suffered at the hands of their Taiwanese management.
</P>
<P>
The riot adversely affected KRTC's image, prompting the Kaohsiung
City Council to pass a resolution demanding that the city
government bar KRTC from recruiting foreign laborers and allow it
to only employ local workers.
</P>
<P>
The work contract of the last batch of Thai laborers expired Dec.
31, but KRTC sought the help of the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) , which approved contract extensions for the 685 Thai
laborers until October.
