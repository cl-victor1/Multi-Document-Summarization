DPP TO PREPARE FOR NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM: CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei,  Jan.  13 (CNA) 01/13/07  20:34:17 (By Lilian Wu)
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  will soon start
preparing for the year-end legislative elections,  which  will
take place  under  a new "single- seat constituency, two-vote"
system, as well as halving the number of legislative seats to
113, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while attending a seminar sponsored by the
DPP on "winning strategy -- an exchange of experience with the
single-seat constituency system in Japan, " in which Japanese
parliamentarians were invited to share their experience.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in his capacity as chairman
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, also presented a piece of
calligraphy reading "wishing you victory" to Yu.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese parliamentarian presented a mascot in the shape of a
horse, upon which Yu said tongue-in-cheek that he would use it to
overcome main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
(Ma translates into "horse") . Yu reciprocated by presenting a
sculpture of a Taiwanese water buffalo.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the DPP hopes to take stock of Japan's experience to cope
with the new electoral system, which some pundits say will
benefit the KMT and pose the greatest challenge to the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Yu acknowledged criticism that the new electoral system will
violate the principle of "every vote has equal weight, " and will
"allow the KMT to dominate" the outlying islands and the
aboriginal Hualien and Taitung constituencies -- traditional KMT
strongholds that the party already dominates in any case.
</P>
<P>
But he said it is "too late to regret the electoral changes now,"
adding that the party must prepare for the worst-case scenario
but make the best preparations. "As long as we unite, the DPP
will succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Japanese opposition leaders said that
when Japan changed its electoral system in the 1990s, former
Japanese Prime Minister Junichi Koizumi opposed the proposal
vehemently, even though he actually benefited from the system the
most.
</P>
<P>
Yu, a former premier, also said that since the DPP took power in
May 2000, he could not visit Japan during his stint as premier,
although he had made six visits since then, each of which had
been fruitful, including meetings with Japanese politicians and
think tanks, he added.
