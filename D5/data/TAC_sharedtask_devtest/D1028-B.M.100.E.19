The trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers, reportedly to air complaints about his defense, media reports said.
In the Sacramento trial Kaczynski is charged in a 10count indictment covering only four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber so named by the Federal Bureau of Investigation because his first victims were from universities and airlines.
The judge in the Unabomber case rejected Theodoree Kaczynski's request to dismiss his lawyers, opening the way for resumption of the trial Thursday.
