Joran van der Sloot and two friends were arrested 10 days after Holloway, 18, went missing on May 30.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on Aruba, was taken into custody about 2 p.m., bringing to five the number of suspects now jailed in the case.
Police have taken van der Sloot to the site before.
Six other men who have been detained at various times during the investigation have been released.
Calls to the van der Sloot's residence Thursday seeking comment were not answered.
No formal charges have been filed against any of the suspects.
