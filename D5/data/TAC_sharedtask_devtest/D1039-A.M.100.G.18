A Dutch filmmaker who outraged members of the Muslim community with his works' attacks on the treatment of women in Islamic society was gunned down and stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street Tuesday morning.
He called van Gogh ``a champion of the freedom of speech,'' and warned against polarization and intolerance in Dutch society.
Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
The murder of Van Gogh immediately brought back memories of the assassination of rightwing populist politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6, 2002 for many Dutch.
