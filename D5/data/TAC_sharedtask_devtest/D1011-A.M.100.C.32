In the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994,one condition -- binge eating disorder -- was pulled out of EDNOS andlisted as a "provisional diagnostic category," the first step in theprocess of achieving its own diagnosis.
Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition ofthe manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, acondition that has been labeled "purging disorder" by Dr. PamelaKeel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics ofbulimia, so does purging disorder.
