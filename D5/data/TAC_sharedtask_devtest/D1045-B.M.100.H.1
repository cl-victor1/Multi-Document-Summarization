China made a rare public apology to Moscow Saturday for any harm that might be caused by a massive swathe of polluted river water expected to enter Russia early next month, state media reported.
The apology follows repeated demands from Russia for more information about the chemical spill and its threat to the Russian people.
Chinese Central Television's nightly news broadcast showed Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergei Razov and paraphrased his apology.
