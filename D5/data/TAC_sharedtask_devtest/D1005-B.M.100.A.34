The drug, however, is no longer available to Kaufman or other Parkinson's patients in clinical trials.
By studying twins with different life styles, the researchers said they sought to exclude the genetic factor.
Parkinson's disease occurs when a group of brain cells which produce a chemical called dopamine begin to malfunction and eventually die.
The embryonic stem cells were then transplanted into six cynomolgus monkeys, which had drug-induced symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease in humans.
Despite its medical ramifications, critics say the research is unethical because culling stem cells destroys the embryo and could lead to human cloning.
