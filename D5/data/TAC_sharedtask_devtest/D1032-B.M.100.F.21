The safety authority has called the gas leak from a production well one of the most serious incidents ever on the Norwegian continental shelf.
Statoil ASA sought government permission Wednesday to resume its full 205,000 barrel a day production from two offshore oil fields that were shut down in November after a natural gas leak.
Norwegian safety officials harshly criticized Statoil ASA Thursday for a natural gas blowout at the oil company's Snorre offshore field in November, and ordered comprehensive improvements.
Work on restarting those wells began Friday, and was slowly building up to 100,000 barrel-per-day capacity.
Police will investigate
