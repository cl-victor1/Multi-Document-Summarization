On Monday, England, 22, pleaded guilty to seven counts of conspiracy, maltreatment and an indecent act, all related to acts of prisoner abuse she and fellow members of the 372nd Military Police Company committed at the Abu Ghraib prison.
Pohl move voided England agreement, which would have limited her maximum sentence to 30 months, and sent all seven charges back to Metz, commander of Fort Hood III Corps.
The judge then abruptly called a halt to the proceedings.
Two other charges against her were dropped.
