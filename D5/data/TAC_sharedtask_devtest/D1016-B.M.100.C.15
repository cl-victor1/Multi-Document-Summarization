Thousands of students Thursday marched in Central Jakarta, demanding that Soeharto be put on trial for alleged corruption and power abuse.
Soeharto, who has repeatedly denied allegations that he amassed a fortune during his reign, was hospitalized twice last year after suffering a stroke and intestinal bleeding.
He said based on the facts unearthed by investigations on the possible misuse of state facilities and on Soeharto's policies as chairman of the charity foundations, as well as based on testimony from experts and others, no sufficient proof was found to continue the probe.
