Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said a special team has been set up by the police to rescue the hostages who were taken in boats by the pirates.
A rebel spokesman said two hostages, including a child, were injured in the shelling of the rebel camp, but the claim could not be independently verified.
By the time they arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport late Monday, they were among the few escapees of a mass abduction by mysterious gunmen 24 hours earlier which left 20 hostages still missing in Southeast Asian waters.
