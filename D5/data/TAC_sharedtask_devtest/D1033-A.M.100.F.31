President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by businesses to politicians during the 2002 presidential poll.
The suicide attempt came after Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to investigate the case.
The 19097 conversation is between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
