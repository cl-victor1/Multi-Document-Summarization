Indonesia was the worst affected of 11 Indian Ocean nations that were hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami.
Jakarta has said that the disaster won't stop the government from achieving its 5.5 percent economic growth target this year.
The US navy aircraft carrier at the centre of American military aid efforts in Indonesia's tsunami-hit Aceh is ending its mission and will leave within 48 hours, US officials said Thursday.
Aid for disaster relief elsewhere in the country has regularly gone missing in the past, allegedly into the hands of corrupt local officials.
