The search came shortly after Paul Van Der Sloot filed a motion in court Wednesday morning seeking permission to see his jailed son, who along with brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, are the last known people to have seen Holloway.
Holloway was on the last day of a five-day graduation trip with 124 classmates and seven adult chaperons from Mountain Brook High School in Birmingham to this Dutch Caribbean island.
Croes said he was contacted by police Thursday night and went to the station voluntarily to give a statement, his employer, Marcus Wiggins, told The Associated Press.
