Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping.
Police there said the kidnappers in Malaysia spoke Tausug, a language spoken in parts of the southern Philippines, but not in Basilan, where the Abu Sayyaf rebels operate.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
He said most of the hostages were Europeans and Americans.
