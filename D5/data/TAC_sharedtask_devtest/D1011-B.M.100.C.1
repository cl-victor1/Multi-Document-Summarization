Two new studies show that genetics may outweigh any environmental factors in producing the eating disorders involved in anorexia and bingeing.
``This is good news for patients and their families,'' said Dr. Cynthia Bulik of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.
In the latest issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, Bulik and colleagues studied records from 30,000 Swedish twins, some with anorexia, and found that identical twins, who share identical genes, were more likely to share an eating problem compared with fraternal twins, who share half their genes, the same as non-twin siblings.
