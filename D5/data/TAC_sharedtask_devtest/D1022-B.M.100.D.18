Japan on Monday said it would annually kill as many as 935 of the small, non-endangered species, up from 440 this year, under an expansion of the research whaling program it began one year after the IWC banned killing whales for profit.
On Tuesday at the IWC meeting, Japan's proposal to resume commercial whaling under regulations was defeated in a vote.
Anti-whaling nations Australia, New Zealand and Britain on Monday tore apart Japan's proposal to expand its whale hunt, saying the practice had no scientific justification and should be consigned to history.
Critics call Japan's program commercial whaling in disguise.
