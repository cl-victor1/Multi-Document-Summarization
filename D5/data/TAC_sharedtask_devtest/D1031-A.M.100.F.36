The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.
Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday, triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
Commercial activity was completely banned in some areas like the Andaman and Nicobar islands and fragile patches like the mangroves.
"The advantage of mangroves is severalfold," Cripps said.
