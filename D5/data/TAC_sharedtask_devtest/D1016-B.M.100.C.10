"There must be a real reason from Soeharto's medical team to explain why Soeharto can't come to meet the Attorney General Office's call," Darusman stressed.
Indonesian former president Soeharto will not come to the Attorney General Office on Monday to undergo an investigation on corruption cases due to health reasons, chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said here on Friday.
Last year, investigation into Soeharto was ceased by the then Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko due to "lack of evidences." Asked about the trial for Soeharto, Ghalib said the attorney general's official duty is only for prosecution.
