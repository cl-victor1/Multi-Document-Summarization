The pollution slick started on Nov. 13 after a petrochemical plant explosion spilled 100 tons of deadly benzene and nitrobenzene into the Songhua River.
Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing informed Russian Ambassador to China Sergey Razov here Saturday afternoon of the situation with the Songhua River's water pollution and measures taken by the Chinese government to tackle the issue.
A top official with the government's environmental safety agency visited Russia's far eastern regions Saturday to deal with the threat from tons of chemical pollutants flowing down a river from China, while Russia's ambassador to Beijing demanded information about the accident.
