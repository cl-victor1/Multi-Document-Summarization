Fast food giant KFC's Chinese subsidiary will invest in a food safety centre to prevent health scares like the one this month over a cancer-causing dye found in its products, state press said Tuesday.
Yum! Restaurants China, the company that operates the US-based company's franchises on the mainland, would put up two million yuan (240,000 dollars) to ensure the safety of its food, the Shanghai Daily reported.
The announcement comes nearly two weeks after KFC pulled several products from its menus after it discovered Sudan I, a dye linked with to increased cancer risk, in the food.
