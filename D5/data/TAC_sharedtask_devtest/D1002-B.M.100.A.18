Sharpton stood beside Diallo's father, Saikou, and accused the state appellate court of moving the trial to Albany to ensure that a white judge and jury would be selected.
The Rev. Al Sharpton continued to protest the decision to transfer the trial of the four white police officers accused of shooting Amadou Diallo to Albany, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela appeared with him Saturday and condemned police brutality.
In its 11-page ruling, the court said it would be impossible for the officers to get a fair trial in the Bronx because of media treatment of the incident.
