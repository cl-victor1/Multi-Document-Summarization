The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.
Besides human impact, coral reefs are also threatened by global weather change.
Coral reefs are among the oldest and most diverse forms of life.
For example, according to a report issued this month by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what conditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.
