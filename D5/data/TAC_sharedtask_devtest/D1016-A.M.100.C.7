After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar faction has finally changed its position, saying.
an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
The law should be upheld if we want reform to go on.
It is possible for the government to consider forgiving Soeharto because of his age but his children and cronies should be tried and punished if they are proven guilty.
