Three bombs in Pakistan's restive southwestern province of Baluchistan damaged a power line and a shop but caused no casualties, officials said Tuesday.
Baluchistan has seen a wave of small bombings and rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen angered by government plans to build new military garrisons in the province.
The move comes in the wake of attacks in Baluchistan by nationalist tribesmen demanding more political rights, jobs and royalties from the province's natural resources.
Pakistan has moved thousands of troops into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on a gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.
