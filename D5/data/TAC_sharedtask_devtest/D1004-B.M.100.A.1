CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest problems facing relief efforts to the tsunami-hit area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is finding about 5,000 people who are still unaccounted for, Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said here Tuesday.
"The biggest problem at the moment is finding those people who are still lost or hiding or injured or incapable of moving," he told reporters.
