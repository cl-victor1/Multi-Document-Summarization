JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in the basement of her home.
No one has been arrested in the death of JonBenet, 6, who was found beaten and strangled in her family's Boulder home Dec. 26, 1996.
Boulder police have been heavily criticized for failing to promptly separate and interrogate the Ramseys and for allowing Ramsey to recover the body of the little beauty pageant queen.
John Ramsey found his daughter's body about eight hours after his wife, Patsy Ramsey, told police she had discovered a ransom note seeking money in exchange for JonBenet's safe return.
