In January, Busch petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service to list the oyster as an endangered species, despite the existence of millions of oysters living in the bay and thriving oyster populations elsewhere along the East Coast and in the Gulf states.
The Asian oyster would not only be good for the livelihood of the watermen,"the entire bay and all the species there." Blacker wasn't sure where Morse would be getting clams and oysters now that so many local shellfish beds are closed.
Some say the oyster industry in the Chesapeake is more endangered than the animal itself.
