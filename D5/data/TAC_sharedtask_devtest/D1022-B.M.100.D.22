The United States again is urging Japan to end its program of killing whales, which the Japanese say is for scientific research, and told Japan any expansion of the program would be unacceptable.
Anti-whaling nations Australia, New Zealand and Britain tore apart Japan's proposal to expand its whale hunt, saying the practice had no scientific justification and should be consigned to history.
The International Whaling Commission defeated a Japanese proposal to expand its scientific whaling program by nearly doubling its annual catch of mink whales, which critics say is a commercial hunt in the guise of science.
