-- The National Zoo is one of four U.S. zoos that exhibit giant pandas.
Stressing that the panda is an animal protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and that there are only about 1.
The National Zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth early Saturday morning to a squealing cub the size of a stick of butter, and keepers say she is caring for it tenderly.
They attempted to mate last year, after which Mei Xiang was vaginally inseminated, and a false pregnancy followed.
Because giant pandas are endangered, each birth helps strengthen the species' future.
