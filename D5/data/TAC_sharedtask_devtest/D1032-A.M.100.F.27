The company was partly privatized in 2001 when the state sold a 17.5 percent stake to investors.
"We have stopped production" at Snorre A, Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for Statoil, told AFP.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
The Snorre field is operated by Statoil, which owns a 14.39 percent share, as well as the Norwegian state-owned group Petoro, ExxonMobil of the United States, Idemitsu Petroleum of Japan, RWE
