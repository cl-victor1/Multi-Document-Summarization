The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago.
While the trial date would come nearly a year after Diallo's death on the night of Feb. 4, it is not unusual in such high-publicity cases.
Johnson has refused to confirm reports, based on people familiar with the case, that the officers will be charged with second-degree murder.
