Boulder police have been harshly criticized for their handling of the case, including Arndt's allowing Ramsey to recover the body.
Dershowitz, who uses the Ramsey slaying investigation during class discussions on reasonable doubt, predicted that the grand jury will return an indictment in the slaying of the 6-year-old beauty queen.
No one has been arrested in the death of JonBenet, 6, who was found beaten and strangled in her family's Boulder home Dec. 26, 1996.
Police have said the Ramseys are under suspicion, but the couple has repeatedly proclaimed innocence.
A grand jury has been hearing evidence since mid-September.
