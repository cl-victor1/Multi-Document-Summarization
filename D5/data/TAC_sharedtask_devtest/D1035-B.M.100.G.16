An Air Force study of veterans who sprayed Agent Orange during the Vietnam War found the strongest evidence to date that exposure to the herbicide is associated with diabetes.
Critics says the Air Force has been too slow and too secretive in studying whether the herbicide Agent Orange sickened Vietnam veterans.
The Ranch Hand study will follow until 2006 the health of 1,300 Air Force personnel who sprayed Agent Orange in Vietnam to defoliate swaths of Vietnam's jungles and deprive North Vietnamese troops of cover.
``We have no evidence that Agent Orange was actually sprayed in Panama''.
