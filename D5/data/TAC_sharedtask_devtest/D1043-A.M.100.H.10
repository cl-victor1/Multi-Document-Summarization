Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
Hariri was prime minister for 10 of the 14 years since Lebanon's 15-year war ended in 1990.
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut earlier in the day.
Over the years, Hariri became more and more concerned with Syrian influence in Lebanon, a product of Syria's military and intelligence presence left over from the war.
