Zhang said reserve will send frequent patrols and rescue giant pandas in danger of starvation.
Bamboo blooming in early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report said.
Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a national gem of China.
The flowering bamboo covered more than 7,000 hectares of the 220,000-hectare nature reserve and the blooming area has continued to expand.
The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region's natural habitat.
