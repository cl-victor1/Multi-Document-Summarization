The move is being taken following the discovery of the H5N1 virus in samples taken from a local chicken farm and the sudden death of chickens at a wholesale poultry market.
To date, the total number of confirmed cases of bird flu in Hong Kong remains 13 and that of suspected cases is six.
Macao is fully prepared for any possible outbreak of the bird flu although no case of H5N1 virus has been found so far.
Hong Kong will adopt confidence-building measures before it resumes importing poultry and starts rebuilding its own poultry industry.
