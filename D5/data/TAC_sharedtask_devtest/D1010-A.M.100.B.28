Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food Sanitation, noted that although there was only a single case of mad cow disease found in the United States, the actual situation in the United States has to be evaluated.
The first signs of mad cow disease emerged in Britain 10 years earlier, in 1986, but the government there denied there was any danger until the evidence became impossible to ignore.
Mad cow sprang up in Britain in 1986 and spread through Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and devastating the European beef industry.
