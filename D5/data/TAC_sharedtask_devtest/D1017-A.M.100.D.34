Hurricane Floyd on Saturday whirred away from the Caribbean's Leeward Islands, but forecasters warned that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could be hit by heavy rains and flooding.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
``We've never had a Category 5 hurricane hit the east coast and this storm is just under that.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles
