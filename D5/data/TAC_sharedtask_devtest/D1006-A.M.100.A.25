The second article in the medical journal, by Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic, criticizes the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx even though hints of danger appeared years ago.
Pfizer Inc. warned doctors on Friday that one of its bestselling painkillers, Bextra, might increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke in coronary artery bypass surgery patients.
The FDA safety officer in charge of the report, David Graham, concluded that Vioxx posed much greater cardiovascular risk than the other major drug in its class, Celebrex.
