WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to endorse a bill Tuesday that would expand federal hate crime laws to include offenses based on sexual orientation, White House officials said.
Congress failed to act on similar legislation last year.
Clinton also will direct that colleges be required to report hate crimes annually and announce a public-private partnership designed to educate middle school students against intolerance.
The partnership will involve ATT, Court TV, Cable in the Classroom and the National Middle Schools Association working with the Justice and Education departments to develop curricula to combat intolerance.
