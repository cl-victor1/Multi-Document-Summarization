The agreement was meant to resolve charges against Debra Lafave, 25, in two counties.
Debra Lafave will avoid prison under a plea deal announced Tuesday.
Lafave was sentenced to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty last month in Hillsborough County to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
In the weeks leading up to the high-profile trial, the fortitude of the family seemed to wane.
Like Lafave, Wallace was newly married at the time of the alleged encounters.
Ridgeway said the attorneys would take a new plea deal to the judge.
