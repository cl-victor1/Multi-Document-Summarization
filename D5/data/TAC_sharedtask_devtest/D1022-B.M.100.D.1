Australia condemned Japan's plan to more than double the number of whales it kills in the name of scientific research, pushing for a vote on the issue Wednesday at the annual meeting of the commision that regulates global whaling.
An Australian resolution submitted to the International Whaling Commission's annual gathering calls for Japan to review its plan announced earlier this week to boost its annual take of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean.
