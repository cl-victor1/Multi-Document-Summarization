But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
"It was terrible news to hear, and it's certainly disturbing reports," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said when he was asked at a news briefing about the US reaction to the poisoning of Ukrainian presidential candidate Yushchenko.
Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in Vienna who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed Saturday.
Yushchenko repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his political rivals.
Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin.
