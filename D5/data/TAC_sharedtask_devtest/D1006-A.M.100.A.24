The Food and Drug Administration silenced one of its drug experts who raised safety concerns weeks before Merck &amp; Co. yanked the blockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack and strokes.
Heavily advertised as an arthritis drug, Vioxx was pulled from the market last week after its maker said a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke.
But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe.
The FDA had no comment Wednesday on the report.
Pfizer says there is no evidence that its drugs have problems similar to Vioxx
