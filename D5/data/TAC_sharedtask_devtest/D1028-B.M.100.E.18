Kaczynski has always said that he was emotionally torn by turning in his brother.
-- The judge in the Unabomber case rejected Theodoree Kaczynski's request to dismiss his lawyers, opening the way for resumption of the trial Thursday.
In the weeks leading up to the Unabom trial earlier this year, David Kaczynski battled hard to save his brother's life.
Last January, as trial was about to begin, prosecutors agreed to recognize Theodore Kaczynski's mental illness, to allow him to plead guilty to 13 of the Unabom crimes, including the three fatal bombings, and to not seek the death penalty.
