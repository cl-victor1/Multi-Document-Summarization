Tests confirm Irish case of human form of mad cow disease Ireland may have suffered its first homegrown case of the human form of mad cow disease after a man in his early 20s was hospitalized in Dublin for suspected variant Crutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or from infected blood transfusions.
Beef and sheep meat has been tested but certificates were not issued due to the fact that the test used has not been officially recognised
