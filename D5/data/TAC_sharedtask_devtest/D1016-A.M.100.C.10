JAKARTA (JP): The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro told a packed news conference here yesterday.
The offices of the attorney general, chief public prosecutor and public prosecutor have asked the public to provide information about the wealth of officials to help the team in its investigations, the spokesman said.
The decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
This is the first time Golkar officially declared war against corruption, collusion and nepotism.
