Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30 months, all dead-on-farm cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over 24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
Mad cow sprang up in Britain in 1986 and spread through Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and devastating the European beef industry.
A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease, especially tissue close to the animal's nervous system.
