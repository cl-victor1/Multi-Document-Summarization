Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing informed Russian Ambassador to China Sergey Razov here Saturday afternoon of the situation with the Songhua River's water pollution and measures taken by the Chinese government to tackle the issue.
Benzene and nitrobenzene flew into the river following a blast at China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) Jilin Petrochemical company, a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province.
Razov urged Beijing to provide full information about the toxic spill, according to the ITAR-Tass and RIA Novosti news agencies.
China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) confirmed that Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident.
