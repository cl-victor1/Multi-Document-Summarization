The fight against corruption in Indonesia should begin by bringing the big fish to court.
Since Soeharto stepped down from the presidency in May 1998, there has been a public outcry.
Soeharto has handed over the control of seven of the nine charitable foundations to the government earlier this year.
According to the Indonesian Observer Saturday, the ruling Golkar said the government need not wait for a special law to probe Soeharto's riches.
Chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said that his client will not come to undergo investigation on Monday due to health reason.
