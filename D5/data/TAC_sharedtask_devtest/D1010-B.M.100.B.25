A gene may protect some people from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human brain wasting form of mad cow disease, researchers said Thursday.
That disease is a degenerative, fatal brain disorder that has killed more than 150 people, mostly in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the 1990s.
Commonly called mad cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a brain-wasting ailment that, in humans, causes a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Definitive testing has ruled out mad cow disease in an animal that federal officials had identified last week as a potential carrier, officials said Tuesday.
