Also on Thursday, the Philippine government has appointed Misuari as chief negotiator for the safe release of 21 hostages, who are now believed to be in Sulu province, the southern Philippines.
The Sulu hostages were seized by Filipino gunmen in a diving resort of Sipadan in Sabah, Malaysia last Sunday and brought them over to Talipao, Sulu two days later.
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado confirmed Wednesday that the hostages abducted from Malaysia had been found in Sulu province, about an hour's boat ride from Sipadan Island, Malaysia where the abduction took place.
