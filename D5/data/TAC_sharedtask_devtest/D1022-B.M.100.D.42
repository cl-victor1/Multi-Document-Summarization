A group of environmental organisations including Greenpeace and the International Fund for Animal Welfare this month urged Japan to halt scientific catches, arguing nothing short of the future of whale populations was at stake.
The 62-member IWC has since 1986 held together the moratorium on commercial whaling, although Norway opted out of the ban and continues to hunt while Japan, Iceland and two Danish territories conduct whaling under exclusions.
IWC now has 61 member countries including China, which banned commercial whaling in 1986.
