The national adverse event reporting system that helps the FDA flag dangerous side effects was of little use in this case because the ailments possibly caused by Vioxx -- heart attacks and strokes -- are so common.
The results of that study came on the heels of an earlier study that showed a greater number of heart attacks in patients taking Vioxx, although there were fewer stomach ulcers and bleeding.
That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrex and Bextra, which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but are not identical to it.
