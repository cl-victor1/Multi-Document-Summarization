WASHINGTON _ The ability of suspected serial killer Angel Maturino Resendiz to avoid capture with phony identification cards illustrates the need for a more secure Social Security document, a U.S. congressman said Thursday.
``Right now, all U.S. citizens are vulnerable to identity theft because our basic identity documents, such as driver's licenses and Social Security cards, are so easy to forge and because no adequate verification mechanisms are in place,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration panel.
