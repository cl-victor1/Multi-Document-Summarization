China has detained a manager of a supplier found to be the source of the cancer-causing food coloring Sudan I found in Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Heinz products.
China launched a severe food safety inspection when Sudan I was detected in a pepper sauce brand, Meiweiyuan, produced by the Guangzhou-based Heinz-Meiweiyuan Food Co., Ltd.
Heinz, a goliath international food manufacturer, has issued a national recall of chilli sauces and chilli oils that may contain the red industrial dye, Sudan I. The agency found the dye in products of companies such as Schweppes, Coca Cola and Unilever.
