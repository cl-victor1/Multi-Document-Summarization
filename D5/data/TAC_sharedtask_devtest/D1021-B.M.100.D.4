The victim, who had sex with Tampa teacher Debra Lafave, has suffered extreme anxiety from the intense media coverage surrounding the case, a psychiatrist who examined the boy told Circuit Court Judge Hale Stancil at the hearing Wednesday.
The judge had forced the state's hand, prosecutors said.
If the case goes to trial, Lafave could face up to 45 years on the charges in Marion.
Hillsborough County prosecutor Mike Sinacore has said that the victim's family had anticipated a trial, but that the media attention prompted the boy's mother to push for a plea deal.
