There is a strong possibility that the attack could be a reaction to the situation in Dera Bugti, because of the violence there.
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and wounding eight.
Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
