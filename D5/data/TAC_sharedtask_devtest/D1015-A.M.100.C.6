KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
A national forest garden was established there in 1992, and in 1993, Hainan provincial government decided to stop commercial tree felling in the area.
It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951.
In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties.
The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province
