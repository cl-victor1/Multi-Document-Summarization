Thousands of people have also been made homeless since Tsunamis, or tidal wave, obliterated villages following a 7.0 degree earthquake on Richter scale in the Bismarck Sea off Papua New Guinea's northwest coast.
Chittleborough said the NTF would also use data from the tsunamis which wiped out villages on the remote northwest coast of Papua New Guinea Friday night, killing more than 1,000 people.
One of the biggest problems facing relief efforts to the tsunamihit area of Papua New Guinea is finding about 5,000 people who are still unaccounted for, Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said here Tuesday.
