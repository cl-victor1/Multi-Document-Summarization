The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.
Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.
The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand jury.
A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant.
The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
