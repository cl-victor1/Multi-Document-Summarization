Floyd was joined Monday by Hurricane Gert, which grew from a tropical storm to a hurricane with winds near 85 mph about 1,210 miles east of the Leeward Islands.
By comparison, Hurricane Andrew was a Category 4 storm when it struck South Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25 billion in damage.
All of the northwest and central Bahamian islands were under hurricane warnings Monday night, as was all of the mainland Florida east coast from Florida City to just south of Brunswick, Georgia.
