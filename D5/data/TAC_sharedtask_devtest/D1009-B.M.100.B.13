Linda Arndt, who was the only detective in John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years.
JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in the basement of her home.
The grand jury investigating the JonBenet Ramsey slaying received an additional 62,001 Tuesday to keep working for up to three more months.
The indictment says the Rapps obtained information about the Ramsey investigation itself.
The lead police investigator resigned, accusing District Attorney Alex Hunter of mishandling the case and trying to protect the Ramseys.
