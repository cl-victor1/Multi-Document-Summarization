Maryland watermen are considering a class-action lawsuit against polluters, including sewage treatment plants and manufacturers that dump into the bay's watershed.
It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster--crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen--has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
Many conservation and anglers groups accuse the menhaden industry of catching too many fish--starving the striped bass and upsetting the bay ecosystem.
In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C., and several states vowed that the Chesapeake Bay would be cleaned up within 10 years.
