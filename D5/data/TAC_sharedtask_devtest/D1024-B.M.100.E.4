The Arab League (AL) Friday condemned the United States air raid on a Sudanese facility as "serious aggression against a sovereign Arab country." America's missile barrage on a pharmaceutical plant in the outskirts of Sudan's capital was called a strike against outlaw states that support terrorism.
The U.S. launched missile attacks Thursday night on a pharmaceutical factory near the Sudanese capital Khartoum in retaliation for the bombings on August 7 against its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
One person was killed in the attack and nine others wounded.
The U.S. has been accusing Sudan of supporting international terrorism.
