army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Rizwan Malik told AFP..
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged in January after rebels launched a deadly rocket barrage on a major gas plant in revenge for the rape of a female doctor.
Officials blame tribesmen for the attacks.
The injured soldiers were in stable condition.
The group is believed to have links to renegade tribesmen, who have stepped up attacks on key installations and security forces in the impoverished province to press their demands.
