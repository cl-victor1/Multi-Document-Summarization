The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
Eight days later, Viktor A. Yushchenko, Ukraine opposition leader, checked out against medical advice, determined to return to the business of winning the presidential election in Ukraine.
Dioxins are a group of organic compounds that contain chlorine.
