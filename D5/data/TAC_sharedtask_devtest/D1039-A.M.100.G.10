Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker and writer who had recently made a television film critical of Islam, was shot and stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street on Tuesday.
Van Gogh's film added to that debate after it was broadcast in September.
Dutch NOS public television reported that the suspect in Van Gogh's murder had ties with a man identified as Samir A., arrested on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack in the Netherlands.
Some Muslim activists called van Gogh's film blasphemous.
Dutch Muslim groups condemned the killing and called for reconciliation.
Escalation is in nobody's best interest.
