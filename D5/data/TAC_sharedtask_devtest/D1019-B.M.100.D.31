The Philippine government said Saturday that it will not replace Nur Misuari as its chief negotiator for the release of 21 hostages held by the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf.
Acting Armed Forces Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim told reporters that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based in Manila about the condition of the hostages.
The Philippine government will exhaust all peaceful means to resolve the Sulu hostage crisis since the 20 hostages were abducted from a diving resort in Sabah, Malaysia, the military said Friday.
