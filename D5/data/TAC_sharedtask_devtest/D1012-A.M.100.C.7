Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis cut short a long holiday weekend and called an emergency meeting.
Two Greek fighter pilots, peering into the plane, saw a lifeless cockpit, according to a Greek air force spokesman, even though the Helios Air Boeing 737 continued flying, apparently on autopilot, for nearly of an hour before it slammed into a wooded, uninhabited gorge near the town of Grammatikos at p.m.. it was mechanical damage but it too early to say.
Things here are very difficult.
