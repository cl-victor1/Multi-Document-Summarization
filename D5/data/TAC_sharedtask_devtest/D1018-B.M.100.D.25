A fourth man detained in the case, 26-year-old party boat disc jockey Steve Gregory Croes, said he knew one of the two Surinamese brothers arrested with Joren van der Sloot from an Internet cafe, his boss, Marcus Wiggins, has said.
Massive searches by FBI agents, Dutch Marines, Aruban police and thousands of islanders have produced no trace of Holloway, a recent high school graduate from Mountain Brook, Alabama.
The latest search group, the Texas-based Texas EquuSearch, also has failed to find Holloway after using specially trained dogs and ocean-searching sonar equipment.
