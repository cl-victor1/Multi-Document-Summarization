The International Whaling Commission (IWC) on Wednesday defeated a Japanese proposal to expand its scientific whaling program by nearly doubling its annual catch of mink whales, which critics say is a commercial hunt in the guise of science.
Japan, Norway and other nations this year are expected to take more than 1,550 whales.
Japan has no cultural tradition of hunting whales in the Southern Ocean.
In all, whaling nations are expected to kill more than 1,550 of the mammals this year.
Japan is conducting research whaling under a clause in a 1986 moratorium.
