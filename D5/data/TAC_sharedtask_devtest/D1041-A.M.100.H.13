Time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors.
"Reef-based activities, principally fishing and tourism, provide economic livelihoods for millions of others," said the IUCN press release.
Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday, triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
