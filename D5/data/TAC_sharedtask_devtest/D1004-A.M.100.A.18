The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast.
Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on beaches.
Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
Meanwhile, Australia said Saturday it will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea.
