Identity theft, one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it to apply for credit.
While shredders can help prevent the theft of personal information from garbage, professional thieves often steal things like credit card applications in the mail.
A new civil law became effective, forcing credit agencies to clear the records of identity-theft victims who can present a police report documenting the fraud.
Within a few months, the identity thief had obtained checks, a driver's license and even business cards in Frank's name.
