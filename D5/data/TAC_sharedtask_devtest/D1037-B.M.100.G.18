A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
The attempts at rebuilding the oyster population have been manifold, from constructing oyster reefs to breeding disease-resistant oysters to establishing shellfish sanctuaries.
But more than that, proponents say, Asian oysters, like their Chesapeake counterparts, perform a natural filtering function critical to the bay's health.
If listed, the oyster would be as off limits to seafood lovers as the humpback whale.
