Zhang said that the preserve will dispatch frequent patrols and rescue giant pandas in danger of starvation.
Bamboo blooming in the early 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 giant pandas, the report said.
Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a national gem of China.
The flowering bamboo covered more than 7,000 hectares of the 220,000-hectare nature reserve and the blooming area has continued to expand.
Flowering arrow bamboo is threatening a colony of endangered giant pandas in China but experts have come up with a plan to save them.
