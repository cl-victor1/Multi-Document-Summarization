He also said that if Soeharto fails to come to the Attorney General Office, his side may send investigators to Soeharto's house to continue its investigation.
"There must be a real reason from Soeharto's medical team to explain why Soeharto can't come to meet the Attorney General Office's call," Darusman stressed.
The Attorney General's Office last Thursday announced that it would summon Soeharto on Monday for further investigation on alleged corruption.
"Medically, it is impossible for pak (Mr).
Soeharto to undergo the investigation," Tampubolon told reporters, without elaborating when is the right time for the investigation.
