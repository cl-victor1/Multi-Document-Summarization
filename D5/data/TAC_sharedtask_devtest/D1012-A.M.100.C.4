ATHENS, Greece -- A Cypriot passenger plane with 121 people on board crashed Sunday just north of the Greek capital, after being shadowed for 43 helpless minutes by fighter jets reporting that the co-pilot was slumped over the controls and that there was no sign of the pilot.
Before the plane crashed, the Greek fighter pilots reported seeing two people trying to take the controls in the cockpit.
The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1998, a year before the airline was established.
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999.
Oxygen masks dangled in the cabin.
