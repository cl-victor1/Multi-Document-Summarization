On Friday, the State Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine required the Heinz Meiweiyuan Guangzhou Food Co Ltd to recall its affected products.
The red dye, Sudan-I, was first discovered last week in a pepper sauce made by a Heinz subsidiary, the Heinz Meiweiyuan Food Co. based in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province.
The dye was found by the Food Standards Agency of Britain on February 18 in a batch of chili powder made by Premier Foods, one of the largest food and beverage companies in the United Kingdom.
