In Laramie, where Russell Henderson is on trial for the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard, social service agencies could lose more than $100,000 unless the county can come up with a way to pay for prosecuting and defending Henderson and co-defendant Aaron McKinney.
President Clinton plans to endorse a bill Tuesday that would expand federal hate crime laws to include offenses based on sexual orientation, White House officials said.
Henderson had been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the beating death of Shepard.
Two other men wait trial in the case.
