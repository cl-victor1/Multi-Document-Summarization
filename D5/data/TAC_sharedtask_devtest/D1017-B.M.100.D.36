Calling Hurricane Floyd ``one of the most serious hurricanes ever to threaten the United States,'' President Clinton issued disaster declarations for Florida and Georgia in anticipation of the destruction the storm may wreak on the southeastern U.S. coast.
Floyd was expected to cut across the Bahamas and then arc along the Florida peninsula Wednesday.
At 8 a.m. EDT, Floyd's center was near Eleuthera Island and about 255 miles east of Miami.
A hurricane watch was in effect for the Georgia coast from Brunswick to Savannah and is expected to be extended to South Carolina in the night.
