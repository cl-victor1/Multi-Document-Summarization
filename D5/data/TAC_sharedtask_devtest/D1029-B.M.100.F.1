A bomb exploded near a railway track in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province on Friday, injuring two soldiers, an official said.
Local residents had found what they thought might be a bomb, and the device exploded as the soldiers were examining it, said spokesman Lt. Col. Rizwan Malik.
The injured soldiers were in stable condition.
The incident happened in Bakhtiarabad, a town about 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Baluchistan's capital of Quetta.
Baluchistan has seen a wave of small bombings and rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen angered by government plans to build new military garrisons in the province.
