Floyd was expected to cut across the Bahamas and then arc along the Florida peninsula Wednesday.
With one exception -- a man who watched the hurricane from his 8th-floor balcony -- residents evacuated their beachfront homes and passed the hours with tourists inside the ballroom of Nassau's Marriott Hotel.
At about 600 miles wide, Floyd dwarfed the small islands, its hurricane-force winds extending 125 miles from the storm's center.
Floyd's top sustained wind eased today to 140 mph -- down from Monday's 155 mph but still a Category 4 storm, the second most powerful designation for a hurricane.
