A small group of people with Parkinson's disease had been pleading for months with the biotechnology company Amgen: Let them resume taking an experimental drug that the patients said had helped them but which the company said was ineffective and possibly dangerous.
Some of patients in the GDNF trial who improved the most had received a placebo.
A complicating factor in the clinical trials is the nature of Parkinson's, a disease that chokes off the supply of dopamine, a signaling chemical, in the brain.
The drug is no longer available to Kaufman or other Parkinson's patients in clinical trials.
