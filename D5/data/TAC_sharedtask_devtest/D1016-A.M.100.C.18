Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
He said many senior officials such as ministers, governors, regents and mayors also had amassed wealth through corruption, collusion and nepotism during Soeharto's 32 years in power.
Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its business dealings.
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
