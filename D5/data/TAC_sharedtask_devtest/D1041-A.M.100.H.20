Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
For example, according to a report issued this month by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what conditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.
