The trial of former math professor Theodore Kaczynski, accused of serial killings with mail-bombs over an 18-year period, is set to open Monday in Sacramento, California, where police say the suspect killed two people.
David Kaczynski and his wife have been given a $1 million reward from the Justice Department for turning in David's older brother, Theodore, as the Unabomber.
Far from disappearing silently into the anonymous maw of a federal prison, confessed Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is busy pitching a New York publisher and writing a Chicago documentary producer about his plans for the future.
