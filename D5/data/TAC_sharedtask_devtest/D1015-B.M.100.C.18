Recent fires in Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia indicate how fragile the rain forests are on a global scale.
The rain forests also have helped to protect the world's climate by cleansing the air.
But the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging, mining, and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable to fire.
About 80 percent of the fires that burned agricultural land, grassland and rain forest in Indonesia since last year are blamed on large landowners who illegally use fire to clear away unwanted vegetation.
