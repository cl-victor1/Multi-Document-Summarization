Conservation Minister Chris Carter told a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists.
Howard would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its proposal.
Commercial whaling was banned by the IWC in 1986, but a small number of countries including Japan maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
