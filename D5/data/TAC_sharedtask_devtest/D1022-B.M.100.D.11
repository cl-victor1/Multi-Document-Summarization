Japan, which conducts research whaling under clause in 1986 moratorium is campaigning for full-scale return to commercial catches.
Japan on Monday informed meeting it intended to double its catch of minke whales to some 880, enlarge cull to include endangered fin, humpback species.
NewZealand's Conservation Minister Chris Carter launched outspoken attack on Japan's plan New Zealand totally rejects Japan's proposals to double number of whales slaughtered in Southern Ocean.
With warnings that 19-year ban on commercial whaling is at risk of disintegrating, whaling nations led by Japan are expected to announce increase in size of their so-called scientific catches.
