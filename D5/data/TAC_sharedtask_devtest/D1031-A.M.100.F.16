Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs.
The United Nations Thursday set aside 1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.
The Indonesian Volcanic and Geological Disaster Mitigation Directorate (DVMBG) said on Friday 28 areas in the country are prone to tsunami tidal waves and called on local administrations and people to stay alert for such natural disasters.
