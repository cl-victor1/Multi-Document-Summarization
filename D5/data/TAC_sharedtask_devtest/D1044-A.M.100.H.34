Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
There is no risk of immediate ill health.
The vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye Sudan I have been removed from sale, the agency said in a statement.
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester Sauce, which was then used as an ingredient in a wide range of products.
