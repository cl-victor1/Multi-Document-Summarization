US authorities lower eruption alert at simmering Mount St. Helens MOUNT ST.
But those events, coming after the mountain erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years, were still less serious than what scientists closely monitoring the mountain had anticipated, and the scientists were still saying Monday that a more significant eruption was likely.
The earthquakes began Sept. 23, when Mount St. Helens began to revive, and gradually increased in intensity and pace, culminating in an eruption a cloud of steam and ash on Friday, the first eruption since 1986.
