Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday.
Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
Meanwhile, FEMA has positioned ice, water, plastic sheeting, cots, tents, and emergency food and medial supplies in Atlanta where they can be delivered within hours wherever Floyd hits land, said Bruce Baughman, FEMA director of response.
All four space shuttles were in hangars, but four multimillion-dollar rockets were on launch pads and couldn't be moved.
