Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest.
The project area now has 12,000 people, mainly of the Li nationality.
