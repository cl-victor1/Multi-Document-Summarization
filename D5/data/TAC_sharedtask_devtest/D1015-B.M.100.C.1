SAN FRANCISCO _ It has a raucous call, massive bill and huge wingspan and until recently it was thought to be a sedentary stay-at-home creature.
But scientists now say the hornbill may be the key to saving the vanishing tropical rain forests in western and central Africa.
Ironically, saving the rain forests may also determine whether the magnificent fruit-loving bird itself survives.
Biologists at San Francisco State University and the University of California at Davis have discovered that the toucan-like birds play an elemental role in reseeding the rain forests.
