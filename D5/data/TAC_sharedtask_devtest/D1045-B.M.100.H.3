A central government work group leaves here Friday for the northeastern Harbin city to investigate into the pollution of the Songhua River, now officially categorized as a "major water pollution incident.".
China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident, which led to a four-day water supply system shutdown as of the wee hours Wednesday in Harbin.
Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing informed Russian Ambassador to China Sergey Razov here Saturday afternoon of the situation with the Songhua River's water pollution and measures taken by the Chinese government to tackle the issue.
