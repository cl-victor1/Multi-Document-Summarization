The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province will be completed this year.
More than 100 giant pandas live there.
More than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, with Sichuan home to 76 % of them, according to the State Forestry Administration.
Since the 1970s, many pandas in the reserve have died because of food shortages.
In Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has been found blooming.
To protect the animal species, dubbed a national gem, China has set up 33 nature reserves
