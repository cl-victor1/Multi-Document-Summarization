The Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident as a result of an explosion on Nov. 13 at a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province, where the river originates.
Two reservoirs on the Songhua River on Thursday reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang.
The toxic benzene-contaminated water, flowing down from the upper reaches of Songhua, arrived at the local water supply inlet at about 5 a.m., and has now entered river sections across the city's urban areas.
