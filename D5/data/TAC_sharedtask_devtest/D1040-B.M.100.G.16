After a 12-week trial that ended with jurors saying they did not believe two Hollywood stuntmen central to the prosecution's case, actor Robert Blake was found not guilty Wednesday of fatally shooting his wife.
In the 12-week murder trial, jurors never heard Robert Blake testify in his own defense.
Jurors in the murder case against actor Robert Blake deliberated for more than five hours Monday without reaching a verdict--and without making any requests to review trial testimony or evidence.
Blake is accused of killing his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, who was shot in his car near Vitello's, his favorite restaurant.
