If convicted of murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait, Blake could be sentenced to life in prison.
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
Blake, 71, is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder.
Schwartzbach argued Thursday that Blake had been willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of their daughter.
He said it was a dumb murder plot -- to commit the crime in a place where Blake is well known, near his favorite restaurant.
