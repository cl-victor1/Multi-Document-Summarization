Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School on Monday.
This year's Columbine High School yearbook features a special insert honoring the victims of the massacre at the school.
Under a school district plan, Chatfield students will attend classes in the morning and Columbine students in the afternoon.
As the investigation into the shootings continued, Jefferson County Sheriff John P. Stone said the man suspected of selling a semiautomatic handgun used in the massacre could surrender today.
Police are still trying to determine if others had a hand in the killings.
Another senior, Lesley Pech, objected to the photos.
