China has applied to the United Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.
The giant pandas are predominantly found in the Wolong, Siguniang and Jiajinshan areas of the province, near the cities of Chengdu and Yaan.
The far western Ganzi and Aba regions of the province that border Tibet are also part of their homeland.
