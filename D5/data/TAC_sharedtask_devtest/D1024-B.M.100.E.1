CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League will convene an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the U.S. missile attack against Sudan, Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Saturday.
The meeting is to ``support Sudan in this crisis,'' and has been called at the request of the Khartoum government, the assistant secretary-general of the League, Ahmed Ben Hulei, told the official news agency.
U.S. missiles devastated a factory in north Khartoum on Thursday, killing one person and wounding nine others.
Washington said the factory produced the ingredients of chemical weapons, but Khartoum said it manufactured only pharmaceutical products.
