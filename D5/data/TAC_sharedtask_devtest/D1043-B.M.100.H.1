The family of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri announced Wednesday that his second eldest son, Saad, would assume the political mantle left by the slain leader.
The announcement came ahead of parliamentary elections that should take place by the end of May.
It did not say whether Saad Hariri would run for elections but appeared to be a first step toward that aim.
"Saad Rafik Hariri will assume the historic responsibility and leadership of all national and political affairs," a statement issued by the late premier's office said.
