Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
Japan has threatened to withdraw from the commission if it does not get approval for increased whaling.
Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "scientific research whaling".
