Slowly. It took Mari Frank two years and became an obsession.
``I've been through identity-theft hell and I survived,'' said Frank, 50.
``I had to write 90 letters and spent 500 hours working to clear my name''.
But Frank, an attorney in Orange County, Calif., turned her ordeal into a service for other victims: She has compiled a guide to help others avoid the same problems.
