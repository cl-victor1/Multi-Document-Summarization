One of two young men charged in the slaying of gay college student Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty today and was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison.
Police allege Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, pretended to be homosexuals, took Shepard to a remote area east of Laramie and attacked him Oct. 6, leaving him bloodied and tied to a fence.
Phelps and members of his Westboro Baptist Church also picketed Shepard's funeral in Casper with anti-gay signs.
Although he pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping, Henderson said his friend and co-defendant delivered the fatal blows.
