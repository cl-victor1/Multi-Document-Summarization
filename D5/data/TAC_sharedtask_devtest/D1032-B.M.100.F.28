In its own investigation, the state-controlled oil company said the leak could have been catastrophic for the platform and its employees had the gas ignited, as it did in 1988 on the British Piper Alpha platform, killing 167 workers.
Norwegian authorities on Wednesday authorized the oil company Statoil to partially resume production on two North Sea oil platforms that were shut down in late November because of a gas leak.
The 140,000 barrel per day Draugen field in the Norwegian Sea was restarted Saturday and reached full production on Monday, its operator, Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos., said Monday.
