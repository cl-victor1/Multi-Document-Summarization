Meanwhile, ambulances ferried more bodies from another morgue in an eastern Athens suburb, where the remains were taken after they were recovered from the slopes of a mountainous region north of Athens, where Helios Airways flight ZU522 crashed early Sunday afternoon.
Authorities said the crash apparently was caused by technical failure that led to a high-altitude decompression.
More than an hour later, it changed course again before crashing near the capital.
The Helios Airways flight crashed Sunday, killing everyone on the plane.
Helios managing director Dimitris Pantazis insisted the plane had been air-worthy.
