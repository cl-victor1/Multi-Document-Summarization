ALBANY, N.Y.
_ Since last week, when Albany was named the future site of the trial of four officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo, most analysis has focused on whether a jury drawn from an overwhelmingly white county will be more sympathetic to the officers than a Bronx jury would have been.
