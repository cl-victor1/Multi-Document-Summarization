Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned bythe same form of the toxic chemical dioxin as the one found in a 1976disaster at a factory in Seveso, Italy, an Austrian doctor saidMonday.
If the pro-reform candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, does not die in a"car accident" before the new Ukrainian election on Dec. 26 (vehicleaccidents are a preferred method for disposing of Ukrainiandemocrats), we may find out who poisoned him with dioxin.
Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) on Thursday denied itsinvolvement in the dioxin poisoning of the opposition presidentialcandidate Viktor Yushchenko.
