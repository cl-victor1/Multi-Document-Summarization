Under the Timor national car project, the government granted tax breaks to PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by Soeharto's son Hutomo 'Tommy' Mandala Putra, to import completely built-up sedans from South Korean carmaker Kia Motor.
Critics claim the government and the Attorney General's Office are deliberately stalling efforts to recover the Soeharto fortune.
Former president Soeharto should meet his office's summons for undergoing further investigation on corruption cases, Indonesian Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said here on Friday.
Muladi said the Attorney General's Office has set up a team tasked to look into the Time report.
