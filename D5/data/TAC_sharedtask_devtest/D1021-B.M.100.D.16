Prosecutors and defense attorneys tried to convince a judge to accept a plea deal that would prevent the case of a teacher accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student from going to trial.
Two weeks after the former Hillsborough teacher Debra Lafave avoided prison with a plea deal on charges she had sex with a 14-year-old student, an Ocala judge has put that agreement in jeopardy.
Hillsborough County prosecutor Mike Sinacore has said that the victim's family had anticipated a trial, but that the media attention prompted the boy's mother to push for a plea deal.
