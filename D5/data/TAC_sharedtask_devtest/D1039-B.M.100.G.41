Six other suspects accused of conspiring to murder Van Gogh were arrested shortly after the murder and have been charged with membership in a terrorist organization and conspiring to murder.
The murder of van Gogh has brought the threat of Islamic terrorism and a jihad, holy Islamic war, close to home in the Netherlands.
Police were also holding six other suspects who could face terrorism charges in Tuesday's slaying of filmmaker Theo van Gogh.
The alleged killer, identifed by Dutch media as Mohammed B., was remanded in custody for 10 days together with four men of Moroccan and Algerian descent.
