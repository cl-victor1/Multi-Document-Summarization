For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with oysters.
Maybe the government will bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay.
Once the Chesapeake Bay's premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to over-harvesting and disease.
Almost 200 million oysters have been planted since 2001, officials said.
In 2000, the foundation rated the bay a 28.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale.
Reduce problems so the bay can be removed from the EPA's ``impaired waters'' list by 2010.. .
