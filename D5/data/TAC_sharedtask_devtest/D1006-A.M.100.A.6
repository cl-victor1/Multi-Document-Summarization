The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
"In light of Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx from the market and otherrecent news stories examining FDA's review of the safety and efficacy of anti-depressant drug use by children, I am concerned whether FDA has been sufficiently aggressive in monitoring drug safety," Davis wrote.
Food and Drug Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe.
