Greece's government and military officials refused to comment on the reports until the end of an investigation into Sunday's crash of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca to Athens.
The fighter jet pilots saw two people possibly trying to take control of the plane; it was unclear if they were crew members or passengers.
The airliner _ heading from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens with 115 Cypriot and Greek passengers and six crew _ flew on automatic pilot to Athens' international airport.
Greek air force jets scrambled when the plane lost contact with air traffic control had been escorting the plane.
