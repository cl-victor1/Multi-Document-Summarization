Long-term environmental lessons must be drawn from Asia's tsunami disaster, especially the consequences of ripping out mangroves and destroying coral reefs that help protect coasts from sea and storms, experts say.
Dozens of scuba divers are removing furniture and other debris swept into the ocean by the Dec. 26 tsunami, hoping to rescue fragile coral reefs and marine life that have long made Thailand's southern coast a top tourist destination.
The tsunami split coral reefs in India's remote Andaman and Nicobar islands chain, burying them under sand deposits and threatening the entire marine habitat in the area, researchers said.
