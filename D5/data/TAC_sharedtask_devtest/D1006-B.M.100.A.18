Merck withdrew its Cox-2 drug, Vioxx, from the market last month, citing a study that found it increased the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of use.
However, Dr. Eric Topol, the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist who pointed to increased cardiovascular risks with Vioxx in 2001, said he's spoken to at least three other FDA researchers who complained the agency minimized their concerns about the drug.
Merck claimed however that "it was vigilant in monitoring and disclosing the cardiovascular safety" of Vioxx and added that the company "absolutely disagrees with any implication to the contrary."
