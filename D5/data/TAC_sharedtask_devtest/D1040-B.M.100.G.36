Jurors in the Robert Blake murder trial went home after a sixth full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict.
Jurors in the murder case against actor Robert Blake deliberated for more than five hours Monday without reaching a verdict _ and without making any requests to review trial testimony or evidence.
Blake, 71, is accused of killing his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, who was shot in his car near Vitello's, his favorite restaurant.
The jury was however deadlocked 11-to-one over a third count of solicitation of murder involving former stuntman Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton.
