Justice Minister Chun Jung-Bae, was accused to instructing state prosecutors not to seek the arrest of a professor under investigation for pro-North Korean statements.
Two former chiefs of South Korea's intelligence agency were indicted Friday on charges of supervising illegal mobile phone taps of the country's business and political leaders.
Both men have denied any wrongdoing.
Shin also said he neither ordered wiretaps nor received information from them.
But local media speculated his death could be linked to his involvement in the scandal.
The Seoul District Court issued arrest warrants for the two, who were arrested later that evening. Roh
