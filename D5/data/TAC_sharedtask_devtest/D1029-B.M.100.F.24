A bomb exploded near a railway track in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province on Friday, injuring two soldiers.
The incident happened in Bakhtiarabad, a town about 250 kilometers southeast of Baluchistan's capital of Quetta.
Baluchistan has seen a wave of small bombings and rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen angered by government plans to build new military garrisons in the province.
Last Thursday a barrage of rockets fired at Dera Bugti killed up to 30 people including 18 Hindus and eight paramilitary soldiers.
The troops and tribesmen have been sticking to a cease-fire since last Friday.
The region has been on edge
