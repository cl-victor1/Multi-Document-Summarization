The prosecutor in the Robert Blake murder trial urged jurors Wednesday to ignore his celebrity, then derided his acting abilities by saying he overplayed his role as a grieving spouse.
Blake ambushed his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, killing her after several other people refused to do the job for him, prosecutor Shellie Samuels argued.
Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.
Blake maintains that someone killed Bakley when he left her briefly in the car to retrieve a gun he accidentally left behind during dinner at the restaurant.
