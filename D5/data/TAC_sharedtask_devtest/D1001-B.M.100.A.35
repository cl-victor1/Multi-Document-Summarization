Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School on Monday.
Columbine students Veronica Nuncio and Breanna Cook, both 17-year-old juniors, showed up for their first day of classes in a small car with the words "We are Columbine" on the back window.
Columbine is still a massive crime scene after two student gunmen went on a shooting and bombing spree April 20, killing 12 students, a teacher and themselves.
Columbine students, whose school is still a police crime scene, arrived around lunchtime today to take over Chatfield for afternoon classes.
The witness list was still in its infancy late
