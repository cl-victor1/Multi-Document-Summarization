At least eight people have been confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on Tuesday evening.
Two people, a man and a little girl, were pulled alive from the snow Wednesday in Ischgl, but a woman was killed and six other people were believed missing, according to authorities and Austrian television.
Another killer avalanche struck Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
The confirmed death toll from Tuesday's avalanche at Galtuer stood at 10 early
