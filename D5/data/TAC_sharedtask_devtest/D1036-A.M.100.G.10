Cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
There is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by poisoning of dioxin.
Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
Yanukovych campaigners rejected suggestions that the prime minister could have been involved in poisoning Yushchenko.
Dr. Michael Zimpfer personally supervised Yushchenko.
