Amsterdam police chief Bernard Welten said late Wednesday that a total of eight men aged between 19 and 27 had been arrested in connection with the murder.
Police arrested a man with dual Moroccan and Dutch citizenship in the killing of Theo van Gogh after a shootout which left the suspect with a gunshot wound to the leg and a police officer slightly injured.
Van Gogh, 47, was widely known for his outspoken criticism of Islam and recently caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.
