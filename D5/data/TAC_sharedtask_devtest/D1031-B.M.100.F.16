As the people of Indonesia's Aceh province try to rebuild lives shattered by the tsunami disaster, officials are assessing the environmental damage to the coast which bore the brunt of the giant waves.
Government experts and United Nations officials say it could take years and hundreds of million of dollars to restore the environmental damage to these backbones of the marine ecosystem caused by the natural disaster.
Indonesia is considering plans to restrict construction along some coastlines in tsunami-hit Aceh province, while planting mangrove forests to act as a natural barrier against high surf.
