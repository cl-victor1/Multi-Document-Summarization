Dozens of scuba divers are removing furniture and other debris swept into the ocean by the Dec. 26 tsunami, hoping to rescue fragile coral reefs and marine life that have long made Thailand's southern coast a top tourist destination.
Thailand's largest coral clean-up operation intensified Saturday, with hundreds of divers rushing to clear tonnes of debris polluting world-class dive sites in the Andaman Sea before April monsoons.
The tsunami split coral reefs in India's remote Andaman and Nicobar islands chain, burying them under sand deposits and threatening the entire marine habitat in the area.
