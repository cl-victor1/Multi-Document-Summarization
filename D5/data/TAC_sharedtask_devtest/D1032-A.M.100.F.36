Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.
The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of 130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day.
On November 28, the company shut down Snorre A after a gas leak was detected.
