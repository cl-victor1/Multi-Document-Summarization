The United States on Monday urged the Ukrainian government to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
"It was terrible news to hear, and it's certainly disturbing reports," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said when he was asked at a news briefing about the US reaction to the poisoning of Ukrainian presidential candidate Yushchenko.
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," McClellan said.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
