The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field 28 natural gas leak.
Statoil ASA sought government permission Wednesday to resume its full 205,000 barrel a day production from two offshore oil fields that were shut down in November after a natural gas leak.
Norwegian safety officials harshly criticized Statoil ASA Thursday for a natural gas blowout at the oil company's Snorre offshore field in November, and ordered comprehensive improvements.
Bad weather hampered the restart of the Statoil fields because it prevented the safety authority from completing inspections.
