Most soccer players on the Santa Clara University women's team will enter the NCAA quarterfinals on Saturday wearing protective equipment -- headgear -- that is as controversial as it is lightweight.
In the 15 months since FIFA, soccer's world governing body, began permitting its use, headgear has been used by thousands of American players from youth leagues to high school to colleges to the pros.
The headgear gained international visibility during the 2003 Women's World Cup and the Athens Olympics.
This has triggered alarmed skepticism within the U.S.
