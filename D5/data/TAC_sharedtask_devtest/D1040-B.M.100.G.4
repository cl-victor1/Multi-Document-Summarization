And there was only one possible order: The Robert Blake Special.
110 witnesses were called during the trial, 74 for the prosecution and 36 for the defense.
In most of the murder plots Blake proposed, Hambleton said, the actor wanted to be present.
Last Wednesday, jurors reviewed testimony by three people who saw Blake at the restaurant the night of the killing.
It was the only time since deliberations began that jurors asked the court for information from the trial.
Several jurors said the issue was not central to deliberations.
Blake said no, but agreed to pose for a photo.
