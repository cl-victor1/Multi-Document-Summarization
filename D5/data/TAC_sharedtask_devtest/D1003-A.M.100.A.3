China has applied to the United Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.
"Now China has about 1,700 giant pandas and 76 percent of them live in Sichuan," said Yang, adding that the provincial government has obtained a financial support of more than 24 million yuan (2.
89 million US dollars) for nature reserve construction from the central government.
The giant panda is one of the world's most rare and endangered species, with an estimated some 1,000 living in the mountainous regions
