Opposition leaders on Monday held Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, demanded and called on the international community to intervene to help this captive nation.
Last September, the United States and France joined together in the United Nations Security Council to pass Resolution 1559, calling for free elections and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.
He resigned the prime ministry shortly thereafter.
Hariri and the other victims were then laid to rest in the grounds of the new mosque.
