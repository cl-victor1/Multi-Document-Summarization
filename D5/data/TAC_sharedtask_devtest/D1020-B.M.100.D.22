Beth Gaston, spokesman for the Agriculture Department's food safety and inspection office.
Federal food inspectors declared unfit for human consumption 21 million pounds of meat and poultry produced by the same Arkansas plant from which 30 million pounds of meat products were recalled three months ago.
The plant on Dec. 22 recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meats sold under a variety of names the largest meat recall ever because of suspected contamination with a rare strain of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
Consumption of food that contains listeria can cause listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease.
