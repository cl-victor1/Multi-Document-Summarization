At least eight people have been confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.
Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton, Tim Hardaway, Steve Smith, Tom Gugliotta, Allan Houston and Vin Baker have been chosen as the first nine members of the 2000 U.S. Olympics team, The Associated Press learned today.
Another killer avalanche brought new heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter.
