Federal grizzly bear biologists in Montana say that years of research shows that the bear population around Yellowstone is robust and recovered.
A draft proposal to take the grizzlies off the endangered species list went out this summer from field offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.
''In some ways I see hunting of grizzly bears in the future as positive tool,`` said Kim Barber, the U.S. Forest Service's grizzly bear and wolf coordinator for the Rocky Mountain region.
