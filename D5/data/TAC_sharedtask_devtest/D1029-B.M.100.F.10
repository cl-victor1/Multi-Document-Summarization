Three bombs in Pakistan's restive southwestern province of Baluchistan damaged a power line and a shop but caused no casualties, officials said Tuesday.
At least eight people, including some soldiers, were killed in the fighting, and gas supplies to other parts of the country were briefly suspended.
Baluchistan has seen a wave of small bombings and rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen angered by government plans to build new military garrisons in the province.
The move comes in the wake of attacks in Baluchistan by nationalist tribesmen demanding more political rights, jobs and royalties from the province's natural resources.
