A $19.4 million plan to reduce pollution and restore bay grasses and oyster habitat to the Corsica River was announced by Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. Tuesday as a ``blueprint'' for saving the Chesapeake Bay.
There, with plates of fried oysters on the table, local chefs said they had seen fish, crabs and oysters from the Chesapeake become smaller and less plentiful in recent years.
The hope is that the new species could take the native oyster's former role in the bay: as a moneymaker for watermen and a natural filter for polluted water.
