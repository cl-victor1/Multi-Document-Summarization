The criminal case against Debra Beasley Lafave, the former Temple Terrace teacher who gained worldwide notoriety after being accused of sexually assaulting a student, ended Tuesday as bizarrely as it began.
Attorney John Fitzgibbons announced an insanity defense, hinting at the tragic death of Lafave's sister, killed by a drunk driver, and other emotional upheavals.
Lafave was charged in 2004 with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition after she allegedly had sex with the student in a sport utility vehicle while another teenager drove.
