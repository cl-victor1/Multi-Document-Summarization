The airliner pilots had reported air conditioning system problems to Cyprus air traffic control about a after takeoff, and Greek state TV quoted Cyprus transport minister as saying the plane had decompression problems in the past.
At least half a dozen people aboard a Cypriot plane were alive when the jetliner carrying 121 people slammed into a hillside north of Athens.
The tissue examinations on those who cannot be recognized will help.
This is the hardest part of the tragedy.
