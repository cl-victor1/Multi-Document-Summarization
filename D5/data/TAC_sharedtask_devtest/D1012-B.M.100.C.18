The pilots of two Greek air force F-16 fighters scrambled to intercept the Helios jet shortly before it crashed reported seeing the co-pilot slumped over the controls, apparently unconscious, and the pilot not in his seat.
At the crash site near the village of Grammatiko, north of Athens, a firefighter described a scene of devastation.
Tsolakis said the automatic pilot had been programmed to fly the plane to Athens airport, and it was unclear how or why it was disengaged.
A Cypriot transport official had said Sunday the passengers and crew may have been dead before the plane crashed.
