The efforts to save the rain forest began a decade ago, as lumber companies that had already cut most of the old-growth forest around British Columbia, by far Canada's richest forestry province, began moving into the Great Bear.
Wild creatures who live there include carnivores such as grizzly and black bears, a mutant white bear that native groups call the spirit bear, wolves and cougars.
The Raincoast Conservation Foundation privately raised 1.35 million Canadian dollars (1.17 million US) to buy one of North Americas largest guide outfitters, Bella Coola Outfitters Company, said Chris Genovali of Raincoast.
