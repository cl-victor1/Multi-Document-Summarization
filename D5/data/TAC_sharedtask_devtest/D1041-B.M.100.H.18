The coral reefs suffered extensive damage, with clusters of coral branches snapping off, said researcher Kevin Shimrone Moses.
"A large amount of the protein that human communities need come from fishing on the coral reefs," he said.
Scientists have yet to conduct a complete survey of damage to coral reefs from the tsunami that roared across the Indian Ocean, but experts fear some of Earth's most spectacular coral formations may carry scars for years.
Coral reefs also may suffer more diseases and even death from the silt and sand that chokes the tiny organisms that builds the reefs.
