Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School on Monday.
The Senate hearing was scheduled before the April 20 Columbine massacre.
The arrest came on the same day Columbine students returned to classes at another school, nearly two weeks after the massacre that left 15 dead.
Police are still trying to determine if others had a hand in the killings.
Under a school district plan, Chatfield students will attend classes in the morning and Columbine students in the afternoon.
Two-hundred columbines were placed in front of the stage.
Some 50 bombs were found in the school campus.
