Scientists have yet to conduct a complete survey of damage to coral reefs from the tsunami that roared across the Indian Ocean, but experts fear some of Earth's most spectacular coral formations may carry scars for years.
Thailand's largest coral clean-up operation intensified Saturday, with hundreds of divers rushing to clear tonnes of debris polluting world-class dive sites in the Andaman Sea before April monsoons.
Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs, conservation groups said Thursday.
