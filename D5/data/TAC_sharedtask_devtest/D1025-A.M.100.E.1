Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
The number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone area has grown at a rate of 4 to 7 percent per year since the bear was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975, Interior Secretary Gale Norton said.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears now live in the region, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.
