Bears that refused to return to a natural regimen were shot, and from 1969 to 1971, the Park Service killed more than 200 bears, reducing them to perilously low levels and resulting in their listing as a threatened species.
Grizzly bears in areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park would be removed from the endangered species list under a proposal to be announced next week, officials said.
But Wilcox pointed out that in Wyoming county resolutions have the force of law and could trigger a rash of grizzly killings once the federal government has ceded authority over the animals to the states.
