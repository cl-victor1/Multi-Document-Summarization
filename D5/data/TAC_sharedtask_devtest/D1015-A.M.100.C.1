RIO DE JANEIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Malaysia are to jointly launch a series of remote sensing satellites (RSS) from 1998 to monitor tropical forests.
The launching of the RSSs, the first of this kind of satellite on a permanent orbit 900 kilometers above the equator, is estimated to cost 37 millon U.S. dollars.
The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said Brazil's National Institute of Space Research.
