Thousands of students Thursday marched in Central Jakarta, demanding that Soeharto be put on trial for alleged corruption and power abuse.
Since Soeharto stepped down from the presidency in May 1998, there has been a public outcry, demanding that he be put on trial for alleged corruption during his rule.
He said based on the facts unearthed by investigations on the possible misuse of state facilities and on Soeharto's policies as chairman of the charity foundations, as well as based on testimony from experts and others, no sufficient proof was found to continue the probe.
