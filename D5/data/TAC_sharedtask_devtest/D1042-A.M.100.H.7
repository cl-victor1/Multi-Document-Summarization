On November 7, 2003, England conspired with Garner and three other soldiers to maltreat a number of prisoners who were subject to their orders and posed in a photograph beside a pyramid of naked prisoners.
England, 22, reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors last week, which would lower her maximum possible sentence from 16 and a half years in prison to 11 years.
He was a staff sergeant, making him the soldier to serve prison time in the case.
Graner had worked as a civilian as a prison guard.
