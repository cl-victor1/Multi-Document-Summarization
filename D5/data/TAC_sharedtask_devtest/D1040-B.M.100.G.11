Prosecutors contended stuntmen's testimony not only proved solicitation charges but also supported their theory that Blake feared that Bakley.
They met at a Los Angeles jazz club in 1999 and consummated their future that night in back of Blake's vehicle.
The judge, found that Corwin's presence during a search of Blake's home violated actor's constitutional rights but declined to throw out any evidence.
One defense expert testified that whoever shot Bakley would have had significantly more gunshot residue on his hands than the few lead particles that police had found on Blake in the 2-1/2 hours after his wife's shooting.
