Norwegian authorities on Wednesday authorized the oil company Statoil to partially resume production on two North Sea oil platforms that were shut down in late November because of a gas leak.
Statoil ASA sought government permission Wednesday to resume its full 205,000 barrel a day production from two offshore oil fields that were shut down in November after a natural gas leak.
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field, which was shut down by a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
