The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
The mail bomb terrorist killed three people and injured 23 others in 18 years.
Burrell said the length of the trial, which is expected to last up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the trial to another city.
Kaczynski was arrested in a cabin in Montana in April last year.
Kaczynski has also pleaded innocent in the case.
