Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30 months, all cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over 24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease, especially tissue close to the animal nervous system.
All results came back negative for the disease.
The human form of mad cow disease is called variant.
