On their way in and out of Chatfield's main entrance Monday, Columbine students could not help but see a gray stone monument placed by Chatfield parents.
Five of the 23 students who were wounded at Columbine remained hospitalized Monday, two in serious condition and three in fair condition.
The memorial service opened with a song by Big Head Todd and the Monsters, who won Columbine's school talent show in 1984.
Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and a TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol.
