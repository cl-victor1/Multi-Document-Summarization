CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Papua New Guinea's (PNG) tsunami disaster has climbed to 599 and is expected to rise, a PNG disaster control officer said Sunday.
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
A 10-meter tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 km north of PNG's capital city of Port Moresby.
