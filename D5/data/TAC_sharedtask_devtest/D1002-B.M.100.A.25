The Rev. Al Sharpton continued to protest the decision to transfer the trial of the four white police officers accused of shooting Amadou Diallo to Albany, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela appeared with him Saturday and condemned police brutality.
Sharpton denied that protests by his followers last year had contributed to excessive media coverage that was cited as a reason for moving the trial.
Further questioning the change in venue from the Bronx to Albany, lawmakers and activists called on the U.S. Justice Department Monday to monitor the upcoming murder trial of four police officers.
