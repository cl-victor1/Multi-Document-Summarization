The International Whaling Commission, or IWC, banned commercial whaling in 1986, but grants limited permits to countries such as Japan that maintain whaling programs for scientific purposes.
An animal rights group on Friday lost a bid to sue a Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales inside an Australian whale sanctuary.
New Zealand is seeking all options including a possible legal fight against Japan's plan to kill endangered humpback whales, local media said Monday.
It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese news reports said.
