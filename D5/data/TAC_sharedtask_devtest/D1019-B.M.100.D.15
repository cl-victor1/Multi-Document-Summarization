Malaysian police intelligence reports indicate that the abductors split up into smaller groups, and have been hopskotching from one island to another in a bid to avoid the hundreds of police swarming the area.
Villanueva said authorities have still to pinpoint the exact location of the hostages who were reportedly divided into three groups, spread either in Talipao and Patikul.
Last Sunday, a group of kidnappers took hostage 21 persons, including Filipinos and several foreigners from an island resort in Sabah, Malaysia, and entered the Philippines' Jolo Island, Sulu Province, where they are now believed to be hiding their captives.
