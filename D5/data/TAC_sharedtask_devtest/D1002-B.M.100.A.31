The Rev. Al Sharpton continued to protest the decision to transfer the trial of the four white police officers accused of shooting Amadou Diallo to Albany, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela appeared with him Saturday and condemned police brutality.
The court ruled Thursday that prejudicial publicity had eliminated the chance of the police officers' getting a fair trial in the Bronx.
The decision by a state appellate court to move the criminal trial of four New York City police officers charged with the killing of Amadou Diallo to Albany County seems unjustified.
