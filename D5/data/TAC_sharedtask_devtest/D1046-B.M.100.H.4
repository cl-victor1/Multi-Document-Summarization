Last month's tsunami could reduce Indonesia's gross domestic product growth by 0.4 percent, but Indonesia's improving financial situation means it is in good stead to cope, the World Bank said Tuesday.
Indonesia is one of the world's most graft-ridden nations.
The earthquake and tsunami that shattered Indonesia's Aceh province caused damage and losses worth US$4.5 billion (euro3.45 billion), the government said Wednesday.
Had the disaster come a few years earlier.
Small-scale graft has already been reported in Indonesia.
Around the Indian Ocean the death toll from the disaster stands at more than 158,000.
