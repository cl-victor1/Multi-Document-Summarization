The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.
A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant.
The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
The officers pleaded not guilty to the charges.
What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at the future criminal trial of the four officers.
