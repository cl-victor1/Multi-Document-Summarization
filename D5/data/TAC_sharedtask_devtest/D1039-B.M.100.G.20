The prosecutor charged seven suspects with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in a conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but late Friday a judge ruled that two of the suspects should be released.
Dutch prosecutors said police have arrested eight more suspected Islamic radicals as part of ongoing investigations into the brutal killing of outspoken Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh.
