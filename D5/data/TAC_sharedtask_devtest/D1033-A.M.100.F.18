President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Hong came under pressure to resign as suspicions arose that he might have acted as an intermediary between the country's largest conglomerate Samsung and politicians and handed out Samsung's slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
Roh has asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case.
He is a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.
