Vioxx has been taken by about 20 million Americans and had produced 11 percent of Merck's total revenues.
Vioxx was taken off the market in September by Merck & Co. after a clinical trial using it was stopped because twice as many people taking the drug experienced cardiovascular disease than those taking a placebo.
Vioxx is a member of a class of painkillers called COX-2 inhibitors, which also includes the Celebrex and Bextra drugs made by Pfizer.
Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three-year study of 2,600 patients, half of whom received a 25 milligram dose
