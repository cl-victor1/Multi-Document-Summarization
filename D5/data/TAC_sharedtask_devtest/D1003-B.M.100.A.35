Giant pandas have been listed under "favorable protection" in Sichuan Province, which has developed 35 giant panda reserves with habitat areas totaling 17,000 sq km, said Deng Xiangsui, director of wildlife protection under the provincial forestry department.
Giant pandas are endangered in the wild, where only about 1,600 remain in China's bamboo forests, and panda breeding in captivity is fraught with difficulty.
Giant pandas reach breeding maturity between four and eight years of age; they may be reproductive until about age 20.
