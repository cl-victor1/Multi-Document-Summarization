Mount St. Helens spewed out more steam on Monday after new seismic tremors that led some experts to warn the volcano could explode at any time.
St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same intensity.
Seattle is located to the north, 160 kilometers (99 miles) from the rumbling volcano.
Scientists have said that any eruption of the mountain would be much weaker than the 1980 eruption that caused 57 deaths and thrust millions of tonnes of ash into the sky, cloaking the cities of Seattle and Portland in a blanket of volcanic material.
