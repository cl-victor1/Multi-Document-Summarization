The U.S. police authorities Monday arrested a man suspicious of supplying the semiautomatic pistol used in the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado State.
Thomas and Susan Klebold met with authorities Friday to answer questions about their 17-year-old son.
As the investigation into the shootings continued, Jefferson County Sheriff John P. Stone said the man suspected of selling a semiautomatic handgun used in the massacre could surrender Monday.
Manes was the first person since the massacre 13 days ago to be arrested and accused of helping gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold arm themselves.
