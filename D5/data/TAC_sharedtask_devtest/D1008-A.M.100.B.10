Once the Chesapeake Bay's premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to over-harvesting and disease.
It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
That is because Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000 bushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in 1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885.
In 2000, the foundation rated the bay a 28.
