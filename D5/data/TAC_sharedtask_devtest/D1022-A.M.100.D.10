Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
The Fisheries Agency, without commenting on plans to kill more whales near Australian waters, said Japan would continue the whaling which it argues is done for scientific research.
Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
