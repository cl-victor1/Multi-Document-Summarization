The trial of a young man charged with killing gay college student Matthew Shepard will include graphic photos and witnesses with felony convictions, a prosecutor told prospective jurors today.
Henderson had been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the beating death of Shepard.
Police allege Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, pretended to be homosexuals, took Shepard to a remote area east of Laramie and attacked him Oct. 6, leaving him bloodied and tied to a fence.
Shepard died five days later.
Authorities say believe Henderson and McKinney intended to rob Shepard, but targeted him in part
