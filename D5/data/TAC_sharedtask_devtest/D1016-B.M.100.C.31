Under the Timor national car project, the government granted tax breaks to PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by Soeharto's son Hutomo 'Tommy' Mandala Putra, to import completely built-up sedans from South Korean carmaker Kia Motor.
Former Indonesian President Soeharto failed to appear on Monday for questioning by the Attorney General's Office.
Tampubolon added that Soeharto still has problems with communication skills both written and spoken, but actually Soeharto really wants to met Attorney General Office's call.
Former president Soeharto should meet his office's summons for undergoing further investigation on corruption cases, Indonesian Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said here on Friday.
