Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin.
Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
``It is possible that we only found the dioxin,'' he said.
Damage to the digestive system suggested that the poison had been ingested orally.
