Pfc. Lynndie R. England, the woman seen holding an Iraqi prisoner on a leash in the iconic photo from the Abu Ghraib prison, pleaded guilty Monday to seven charges stemming from prisoner abuse.
Lynndie England on Monday pled guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
Pfc. Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
