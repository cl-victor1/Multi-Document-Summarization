Australia strongly opposes Japanese plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in the name of scientific research.
The Australian government on Friday foiled a court bid by international animal rights activists to stop a Japanese company from killing whales inside the country's Antarctic sanctuary.
