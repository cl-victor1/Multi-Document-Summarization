The fight against corruption in Indonesia should begin by bringing the big fish to court.
Local reports said Soeharto and his family have amassed at least 15 billion U.S. dollars.
Soeharto was forced down on May 21 last year amid the country's worst economic and political crisis.
According to the Indonesian Observer Saturday, the ruling Golkar said the government need not wait for a special law to probe Soeharto's riches.
Chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said that his client will not come to undergo investigation on Monday due to health reason.
