There's no oysters.
ON MARYLAND'S SHORE, AN ELEGY, PERHAPS, FOR OYSTER SEASON Some officials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential replacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease and pollution.
Just a few years ago, there were thousands of people oystering in Maryland; this year, they expect fewer than 150.
In five years alone, the Maryland oyster harvest has dropped 92 percent, hitting a record low last year with 26,000 bushels.
Then there is the Chinese oyster, which governors in Maryland and Virginia believe might resist disease and provide a natural pollution filter.
