More than 60 people have died in avalanches in Europe this year.
Seven miles away the death toll rose to 16 from an avalanche yesterday.
Six remained missing, Austrian state radio said.
Witnesses said there were no casualties in the attack, in which a passenger on a motor scooter sprayed bullets.
Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border, where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of snow and rubble for survivors.
All over Europe, the avalanches took lives and destroyed homes.
