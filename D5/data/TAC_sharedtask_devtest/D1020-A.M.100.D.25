Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing four.
Consumers who have purchased meat products manufactured at Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City, Ark., plant in the last six months are being urged to return them because of concerns of possible contamination with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria.
When ingested, Listeria bacteria can cause illness and death among the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and those with weakened immune systems.
