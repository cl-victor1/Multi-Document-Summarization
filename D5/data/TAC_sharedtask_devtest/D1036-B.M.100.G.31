Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
Yushchenko fell ill on September 6, while holding a comfortable lead over his chief presidential rival Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich in opinion polls just weeks before a first round presidential election.
Yushchenko had told reporters that he suspected that he swallowed the poison during a dinner he had with SBU chief Ihor Smeshko and his deputy.
