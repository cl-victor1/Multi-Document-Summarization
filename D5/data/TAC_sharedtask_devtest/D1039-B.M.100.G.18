The Justice Ministry said the suspect in the murder of Theo van Gogh _ a distant relative of the famous painter Van Gogh _ is a Muslim radical associated with Islamic fundamentalists on a terrorist watch list.
Dutch police arrested six people, all of Moroccan or Algerian origin, after the killing of Van Gogh, who was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street.
The chief suspect in Van Gogh's murder, identified in Dutch media as Mohammed B., is a 26-year-old with dual Moroccan and Dutch nationality.
