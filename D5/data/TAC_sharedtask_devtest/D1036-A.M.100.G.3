Speaking to reporters Sunday at the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Vienna, where doctors announced Saturday that they had confirmed dioxin poisoning, Yushchenko said a full-scale investigation should wait until after Dec. 26, when he faces Yanukovych in a repeat election.
Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office announced Sunday it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
