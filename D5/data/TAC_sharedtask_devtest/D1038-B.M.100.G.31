Little ash, the greatest health concern for downwind towns, was emitted during the steam explosion, scientists said.
For the fifth straight day, Mount St. Helens let out a burst of steam and ash on Tuesday, similar to the earlier bursts that have risen out of the crater and perhaps larger.
A tremor shook Mount St. Helens early Sunday for 25 minutes, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption.
That dome was formed by about six years' worth of relatively small eruptions of magma that occurred inside the mountain's mile-wide crater after the 1980 explosion.
