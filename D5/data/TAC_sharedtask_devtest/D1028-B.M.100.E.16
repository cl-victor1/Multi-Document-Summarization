David Kaczynski and his wife have been given a 1 million reward from the Justice Department for turning in David's older brother, Theodore, as the Unabomber.
David Bischel, the new president of the industry association, praised David Kaczynski's offer to distribute the reward money among his brother's victims.
In the weeks leading up to the Unabom trial earlier this year, David Kaczynski battled hard to save his brother's life.
The trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers, reportedly to air complaints about his defense.
