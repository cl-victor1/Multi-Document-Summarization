Dutch politicians and commentators were united Tuesday in their condemnation of the murder, in broad daylight on an Amsterdam street, of controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh and called for calm together with representatives of the Dutch Muslim community.
It is assumed that Van Gogh was killed because of his outspoken criticism of Islam after police said the alleged gunman was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
Dutch Muslim groups _ despite disagreeing with Van Gogh's views on Islam _ condemned the killing and called for reconciliation.
