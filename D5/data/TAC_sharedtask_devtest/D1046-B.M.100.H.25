A powerful earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004 triggered a devastating tsunami that swept across the coastal countries of the Indian Ocean, wiping off villages and killing nearly 280,000 people.
The US navy aircraft carrier at the centre of American military aid efforts in Indonesia's tsunami-hit Aceh is ending its mission and will leave within 48 hours, US officials said Thursday.
Last month's tsunami could reduce Indonesia's gross domestic product growth by 0.4 percent, but Indonesia's improving financial situation means it is in good stead to cope, the World Bank said Tuesday.
