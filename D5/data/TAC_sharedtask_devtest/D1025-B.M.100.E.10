In proposing to lift endangered-species protections from bald eagles and some grizzly bears, the Bush administration is heralding two triumphs of resilience and recovery.
In December, environmental groups privately raised 1.35 million Canadian dollars (1.17 million US dollars) to purchase a commercial hunting license to stop the contentious grizzly bear hunt in the area.
The efforts to save the rain forest began a decade ago, as lumber companies that had already cut most of the old-growth forest around British Columbia, by far Canada's richest forestry province, began moving into the Great Bear.
