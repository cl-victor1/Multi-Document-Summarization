Scientists on Saturday saw an increase of fumaroles, a hole from which hot gases and vapors emanate, in St. Helens' lava dome and detected carbon dioxide, the USGS said.
No injuries or damage to property were reported.
Still when 57 people were killed and towns 250 miles (402 kilometers) away were coated with ash.
Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
That makes us think this is the end of the eruption.
Something could happen at any time, basically.
Instruments on or hovering above the surface offer only indirect suggestions of what is happening.
