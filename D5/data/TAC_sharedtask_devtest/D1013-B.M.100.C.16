Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge accounts or purchase merchandise.
The Social Security Administration received more than 30,000 complaints about the misuse of Social Security numbers last year; most of the complaints concerned identity theft.
The stockpile of public information is as potentially frightening as it is extensive: professors display test results by social security numbers, the long and revealing trail of E-Z pass tags, and prisoners--at least in other states--uncover personal information of innocent citizens.
