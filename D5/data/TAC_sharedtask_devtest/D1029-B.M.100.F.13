A bomb exploded near a railway track in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province on Friday, injuring two soldiers.
The commander, Brig.
Salim Nawaz, said on Tuesday that thousands of Bugti tribesmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons have surrounded a military base near Dera Bugti, in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province, with some setting up roadblocks and digging trenches.
The tribe's charismatic chieftain, Nawab Akbar Bugti, has long dominated this remote corner of southwestern Pakistan--site of the country's richest gas fields.
Pakistan has deployed police commandos to guard trains and railway stations after frequent blasts in its insurgency-hit southwestern province.
