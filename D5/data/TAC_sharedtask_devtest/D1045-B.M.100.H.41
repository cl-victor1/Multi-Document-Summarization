Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing informed Russian Ambassador to China Sergey Razov here Saturday afternoon of the situation with the Songhua River's water pollution and measures taken by the Chinese government to tackle the issue.
The Chinese Ministry of Water Resources has ordered two reservoirs along the Songhua River to discharge more water downward to dilute the benzene slick on the river in northeast China.
Razov urged Beijing to provide full information about the toxic spill, according to the ITAR-Tass and RIA Novosti news agencies.
