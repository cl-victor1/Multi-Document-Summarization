Colonel James Pohl halted court-martial proceedings Wednesday after Charles Graner, the alleged ringleader in the abuse scandal, testified that he had ordered Private Lynndie England to hold the leash.

Charles Graner Jr., contending that notorious photos taken of England at the prison were to have a legitimate use, could endanger England's guilty plea to seven abuse charges.
On Monday, England, 22, pleaded guilty to seven counts of conspiracy, maltreatment and an indecent act, all related to acts of prisoner abuse she and fellow members of the Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company committed at the Abu Ghraib
