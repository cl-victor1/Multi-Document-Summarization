The Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
"After the explosion at the Jilin Petrochemical Company under China National Petroleum Corporation, our observation showed pollutants containing benzene had flown into the Songhua River and caused water pollution," said an official with SEPA.
Two reservoirs on the Songhua River on Thursday reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang.
As the polluted water flows downstream, the density of pollutants has markedly subsided.
