People eating animal meat products contaminated with mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can develop a human variant of the fatal brain-wasting disease, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
A French goat slaughtered in 2002 has tested positive for "mad cow" disease, the French agriculture ministry said Friday, in what is the first known case in the world of the fatal illness in an animal other than a bovine.
Ministry officials said people will not get infected with the human variant of mad cow disease by eating domestically produced beef in Japan because Japan tests all cattle for mad cow disease
