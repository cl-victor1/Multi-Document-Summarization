Robert Blake deserves to be convicted of killing his wife, and the actor's celebrity shouldn't gain him any special treatment, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday in closing arguments.
Robert Blake's defense rested its case without calling him to the stand, but he was able to tell jurors his story in a videotape of a TV interview that was played in court.
Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.
Samuels cited testimony that Blake tried to have Bakley arrested and her pregnancy aborted so that he would not have to marry her.
