Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov.
Circuit Judge Hale Stancil last week turned down a plea agreement that would allow the former teacher, 25-year-old Debra Lafave, to avoid a prison sentence.
A judge has rejected a plea deal in which a former teacher would have avoided prison time for having sex with a 14-year-old student, prosecutors said.
If the case goes to trial, Lafave could face up to 45 years on the charges in Marion.
