Two former South Korean intelligence chiefs arrested in wiretapping scandal facing trial are Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National Intelligence Service successively between December 1999 and April 2003, for allegedly supervising illegal mobile phone taps of the country's leading figures.
The extensive wiretappings, dubbed the X-files by South Korean media, revealed not only problems with the agency, but also collusion between top conglomerates and politicians one of the inveterate ills of South Korean politics.
Both denied the charges but the Seoul District Court issued warrants saying they were suspected of playing a role in illicit bugging operations.
