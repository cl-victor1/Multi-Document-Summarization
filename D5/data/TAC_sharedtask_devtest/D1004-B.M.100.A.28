NTF research assistant James Chittleborough said the NTF was simulating tsunamis to determine which areas of the Australian coast were most at risk and to develop a model which would be used in the warning system.
Hundreds of people were injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior.
Thousands of people have also been made homeless since Tsunamis, or tidal wave, obliterated villages following a 7.0 degree earthquake on Richter scale in the Bismarck Sea off Papua New Guinea's northwest coast.
