The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
The prosecutor in the Robert Blake murder trial urged jurors Wednesday to ignore his celebrity, then derided his acting abilities by saying he overplayed his role as a grieving spouse.
Robert Blake starred in such films as "In Cold Blood" and in TV shows like "Baretta, " but he could n't pull off the role of a distraught husband, a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in the actor's murder trial.
