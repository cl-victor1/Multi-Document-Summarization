A Canadian packing plant of IBP Inc. voluntarily recalled 46,000 pounds of ground beef products Saturday because of possible contamination with E. coli 0157: H7,, the second recall in two days for the United States' largest beef processor.
Rochester Meats Inc., of Rochester, Minn., last week recalled 170,780 pounds of product--the equivalent of one day's production.
``We have genetic fingerprints that link E. coli 0157: H7 in samples of the meat from Rochester Meats to the patients in Maine who have become ill,'' said Beth Gaston, spokesman for the Agriculture Department's food safety and inspection office.
