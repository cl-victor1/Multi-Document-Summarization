Consumers who have purchased meat products manufactured at Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City, Ark., plant in the last six months are being urged to return them because of concerns of possible contamination with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria.
Although Bil Mar is the only plant to have an outbreak with illnesses traced to its products, several others across the country have had to recall products after tests detected listeria.
Doctors say the prospective mother was struck by listeriosis, a disease caused by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen often found in hot dogs, luncheon meats, soft cheese, even milk.
