The 71-year-old actor is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait.
Schwartzbach suggested throughout the trial that someone other than Blake, possibly one of the hundreds of men he said Bakley had bilked with naked pictures and promises of a sexual relationship, killed her in the moments she sat alone in Blake's car.
In most of the murder plots Blake proposed, Hambleton said, the actor wanted to be present.
When asked who then was the real murderer of his wife Blake snapped: "Shut up."
