Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain cells in rats with Parkinson's disease, University of Pittsburgh researchers report.
A new robotic microscope that follows a brain cell in the lab from a normal state to its death has led researchers to a surprising finding that appears to debunk a long-standing theory about Huntington's disease.
While proteins that cause Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are different, the pathology--these deposits in or around brain cells--is similar.
Cures for these and other diseases, many scientists now believe, could come from research into human embryonic stem cells.
