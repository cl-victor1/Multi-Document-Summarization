Thousands of government workers and their families have evacuated a remote town in southwestern Pakistan amid fears of renewed fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces after clashes left at least 30 people dead.
Seventeen minority Hindus were killed when their temple was hit by rockets during fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces in a restive tribal town in southwestern Pakistan last week.
Tensions in the region escalated Thursday when tribesmen ambushed a convoy of troops and fired rockets at a military base on the outskirts of Dera Bugti, 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Baluchistan province's capital, Quetta.
