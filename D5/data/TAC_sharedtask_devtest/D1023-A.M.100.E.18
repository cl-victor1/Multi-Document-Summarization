In Switzerland, teams of rescue workers searching for survivors found five more bodies on Tuesday, after an avalanche that crushed chalets near Evolene on Sunday.
The latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where two people were killed and two survivors were pulled from the snow and debris.
All told, the avalanches were the worst in Austria since a series of snowslides killed 56 people in the village of Blons in January 1954.
Franz Wenko, a hotel operator in Galtuer, told Austrian television.
In Switzerland, officials said the death toll over the weekend had risen to seven.
