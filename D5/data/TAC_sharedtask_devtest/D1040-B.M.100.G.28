After a 12-week trial that ended with jurors saying they did not believe two Hollywood stuntmen central to the prosecution's case, actor Robert Blake was found not guilty Wednesday of fatally shooting his wife.
Robert Blake, the 71-year-old actor who has spent his entire life in front of a camera, was spared death in prison on Wednesday, when a jury acquitted him of the murder of his wife.
But Blake's attorney, M. Gerald Schwartzbach, was able to undermine their credibility by putting on evidence that their admitted use of cocaine and methamphetamine could have caused them to be delusional.
