Continued poor weather conditions in the North Sea also hindered British-Dutch oil giant Shell from resuming production on Tuesday on its Norwegian platform Draugen, which was shut down last Friday after its loading equipment was damaged.
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia, with an average daily production of three million barrels.
The shutdown of Snorre and the Vigdis field meant a loss of 205,000 barrels of oil a day in production, or 6.4 percent of Norway's roughly 3.2 million barrels a day of production.
