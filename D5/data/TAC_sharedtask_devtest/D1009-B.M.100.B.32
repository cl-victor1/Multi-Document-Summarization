(AP) -- Linda Arndt, who was the only detective in John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years.
Boulder police have been heavily criticized for failing to promptly separate and interrogate the Ramseys and for allowing Ramsey to recover the body of the little beauty pageant queen.
The child beauty queen's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under suspicion.
Other than his parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, Burke was the only person known to have been in the house when the 6-year-old was killed.
