Lebanese Prime Minister Omar Karami announced resignation of his government on Monday amid massive demonstrations over the assassination of ex-prime minister Rafik al Hariri.
The Lebanese parliament opened Monday a special session to vote on a no-confidence motion against the government over the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri two weeks ago.
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud on Thursday reappointed pro-Syrian Omar Karami to be the country's new premier, 10 days after Karami resigned under massive protests and pressure.
Lebanon plunged into political turbulence after Hariri's killing, for which the opposition has blamed pro-Syrian authorities.
