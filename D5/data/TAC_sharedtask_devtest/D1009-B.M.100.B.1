DENVER (AP) -- The police detective who was present when the body of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found by her father says she feared for her life.
Linda Arndt, who was alone in the room with John Ramsey, told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in an interview broadcast this morning that she remembers ``tucking my gun right next to me...
and consciously counting out the 18 bullets''.
No one has been charged, but authorities say the child's parents remain under suspicion.
They have denied any involvement.
Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home on Dec .
