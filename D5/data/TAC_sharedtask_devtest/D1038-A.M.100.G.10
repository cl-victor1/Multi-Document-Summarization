Scientists on Saturday saw an increase of fumaroles, a hole from which hot gases and vapors emanate, in St. Helens' lava dome and detected carbon dioxide, the USGS said.
No injuries or damage to property were reported.
Still when 57 people were killed and towns 250 miles (402 kilometers) away were coated with ash.
It was like a big burp.
The expectation is that magma -- underground molten rock -- will reach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more eruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger.
Something could happen at any
