Dutch prosecutors said Friday that an Islamic radical accused of killing Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh and slitting his throat will be tried as a terrorist.
A letter left on the body of van Gogh threatened Hirsi Ali because it said she had turned away from Islam, as well as Amsterdam's mayor Job Cohen whom it said had pitted Jews against non-Jews.
Prosecutor's working on Van Gogh's murder are investigating whether the men arrested were part of a larger network.
All the suspects are of Moroccan or Algerian descent, though several hold Dutch passports, including the alleged killer.
