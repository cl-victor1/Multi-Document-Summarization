Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
China's largest group of wild Indian elephants, as well as gaurus, peacocks, gibbons, and 105 other endangered species under protection, inhabit the primeval forest.
China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
