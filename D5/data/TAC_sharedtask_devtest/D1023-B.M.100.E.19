Three German tourists were killed by an avalanche in Italy's northern mountain region near the Austrian border Thursday.
The death toll from two Austrian avalanches rose today to 33.
The search for avalanche victims drew near a close today in the Austrian Alps, where exhausted rescuers found four more bodies, bringing the death toll to 37.
The avalanche came off a mountain at about 2,700m high in the Val di Roia, not far from the Italian border with Austria and quite close to the Austrian resort of Galtuer, where 38 people were killed by an avalanche on February 24.
