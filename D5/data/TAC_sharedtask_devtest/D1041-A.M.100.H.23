The conservation union -- which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species -- also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
But the new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae may move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events.
The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
About 16 percent of global reefs had been damaged by the bleaching.
