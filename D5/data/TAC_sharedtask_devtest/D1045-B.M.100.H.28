Now that China has learned and matured from the SARS experience, it is also likely to take a big stride forward after the Songhua River pollution incident.
A work group of the State Council, China's cabinet, will leave here on Friday afternoon for Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, to investigate the major water pollution in Songhua River, which has led to a four-day water supply suspension in the city.
Environmental monitoring posts around Harbin found that pollution levels in the Songhua had dropped almost to normal Saturday as the slick moved past the city.
