President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
The arrested former NIS official, 58-year-old Gong Un-Yong, is accused of handing over an audio tape containing the conversation to a Korean-American businessman who was arrested last week.
The suicide attempt came after Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to investigate the case.
Opposition presidential candidate Kim Dae-jung defeated governing party candidate Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 election.
