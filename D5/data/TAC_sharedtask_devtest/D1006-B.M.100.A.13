Merck and federal officials should have withdrawn the painkiller Vioxx from the market as early as 2000 because studies of the drug had clearly shown that it doubled the risk of heart attacks among users, according to a study released Thursday by The Lancet, a British medical journal.
The e-mail and meeting notes show that Dr. David Graham, an official in the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, is seeking to begin a study of the safety of Bextra and Mobic, two arthritis pills that are similar to Vioxx.
Bextra, Celebrex and Vioxx are all Cox-2 inhibitors.
