Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by the same form of the toxic chemical dioxin as the one found in a 1976 disaster at a factory in Seveso, Italy, an Austrian doctor said Monday.
Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
David V. Zhvaniya, the Yushchenko campaign manager, said he and Yushchenko had refused to appear because they had no faith in the commission.
