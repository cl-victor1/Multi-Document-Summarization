Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection.

As the Bush administration prepares to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list, a schism has emerged in the environmental movement over whether the bears remain at risk.
