Salim Nawaz, said on Tuesday that thousands of Bugti tribesmen armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons have surrounded a military base near Dera Bugti, in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province, with some setting up roadblocks and digging trenches.
The conflict was linked to a tribal leader's demands for more revenues from natural gas extracted from the region, about 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the city of Quetta, the capital of southwestern Baluchistan province.
Pakistan has moved thousands of troops into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on a gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.
