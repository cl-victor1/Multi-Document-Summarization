The Philippine Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf has threatened to behead some of the 21 hostages they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia because they do not want to talk with a government negotiator.
Mercado, who visited Sulu on Wednesday, confirmed the participation of the Muslim rebel group Abu Sayyaf in the abduction.
Negotiations for the release of the Sulu hostages have started by Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about 40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island province of Sulu.
