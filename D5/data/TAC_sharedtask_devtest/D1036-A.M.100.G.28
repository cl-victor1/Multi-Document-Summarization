Returning to Kiev after checking out of a clinic in Vienna, Austria, Yushchenko said he was sure that authorities were responsible for the dioxin poisoning that had disfigured his face and caused other symptoms.
Saturday's announcement potentially raised the stakes by increasing the possibility that if the poisoning were an assassination attempt, those responsible might be caught and punished under a Yushchenko presidency.
Yushchenko's dioxin levels in blood and tissue samples taken in September but only recently tested specifically for that substance were at least 1,000 times higher than normal, a level Zimpfer said required a dose of just milligrams.
