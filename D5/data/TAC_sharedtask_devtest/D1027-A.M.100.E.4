Seven people were dismissed Thursday as jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard.
Shepard died following a brutal beating in Laramie in October.
The killing ``has literally injected into our community a feeling of guilt.
The first of Shepard's two alleged attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday.
The trial is expected to last five weeks.
Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, are charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted.
The prospective jurors will be questioned individually in the judge's chambers.
