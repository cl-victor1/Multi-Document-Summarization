Richard Pelz, chief executive of the Circle C oyster ranch on St. Jerome Creek in St. Mary's County in Southern Maryland, believes an endangered species designation would destroy his business.
A $19.4 million plan to reduce pollution and restore bay grasses and oyster habitat to the Corsica River was announced by Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. Tuesday as a ``blueprint'' for saving the Chesapeake Bay.
The Eastern oyster's catastrophic decline there has led Wolf-Dieter Busch, a biologist and environmental consultant in Maryland, to petition the National Marine Fisheries Service to place it on the endangered species list.
