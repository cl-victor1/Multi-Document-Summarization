When Parkinson's disease occurs, for unexplained reasons, these cells begin to die at a faster rate and the amount of dopamine produced in the brain decreases.Earlier this year, after taking an experimental drug in a clinical trial, Kaufman built new kitchen cabinets and an outdoor deck.
Amgen's decision reverberated beyond the 48 patients in the trials because the drug, called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, had the potential to stall or even reverse the progression of the disease rather than just reduce the symptoms, as the currently available Parkinson's drugs do.
