The judge presiding over the court-martial of Lynndie England, the soldier photographed with an Iraqi detainee on a leash, Wednesday threw out her guilty plea for one of her charges in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.
Colonel James Pohl halted court-martial proceedings Wednesday after Charles Graner, the alleged ringleader in the abuse scandal, testified that he had ordered Private Lynndie England to hold the leash.
Col. James Pohl entered a plea of not guilty for England to a charge of conspiring with Pvt.
Pohl then spent three hours Monday intensely questioning England's guilty plea before accepting it.
