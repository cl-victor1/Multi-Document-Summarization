A former free-lance writer for the Globe says his editors at the supermarket tabloid talked about trying to blackmail a Boulder detective into granting an interview about the JonBenet Ramsey case.
The evidence amassed in the slaying of JonBenet Ramsey seems to point in two distinct directions: toward a family member and toward an intruder.
Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home on Dec. 26, 1996, after Mrs. Ramsey called 911 to report finding a 2 1/2-page ransom note.
Court records said Arndt asked Ramsey to search the house for anything unusual.
