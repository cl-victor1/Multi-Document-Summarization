Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.
The crowd began massing quietly in front of Rafik Hariri's mansion in the early dawn hours Wednesday as Lebanon prepared to bury him and the six bodyguards who were killed with him in a bomb blast on Monday.
It seemed that the most far-reaching effect of the assassination would be a fundamental change in the relationship between Lebanon and Syria, with a newly emboldened opposition movement renewing calls for Syria's withdrawal.
