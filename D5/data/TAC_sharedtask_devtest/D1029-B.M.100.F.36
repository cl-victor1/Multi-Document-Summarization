A parliamentary delegation headed Tuesday to a remote town in Pakistan's southwest Baluchistan province in a bid to end a siege by hundreds of armed tribesmen.
"The parliamentary committee on Baluchistan and a media team have left Islamabad this morning for Sui and Dera Bugti," information minister Sheikh Rashid told AFP.
Three bombs in Pakistan's restive southwestern province of Baluchistan damaged a power line and a shop but caused no casualties, officials said Tuesday.
The move comes in the wake of attacks in Baluchistan by nationalist tribesmen demanding more political rights, jobs and royalties from the province's natural resources.
