(BC-Sudan-US Attack) - - - - KHARTOUM -- Sudan decided Friday to recall its diplomats in Washington to protest the U.S. air raid on a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Thursday.
The Arab League (AL) Friday condemned the United States air raid on a Sudanese facility as "serious aggression against a sovereign Arab country." Such reluctance was even evident at Saturday's rally.
It justified its attack on Sudan on its assessment that the destroyed factory was manufacturing chemical weapons, which could be used by terrorists to attacks U.S. targets.
Turkey strongly supports the bilateral and international cooperation agreements against terrorism.
