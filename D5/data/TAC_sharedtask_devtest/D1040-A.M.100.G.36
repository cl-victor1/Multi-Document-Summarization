The prosecutor in the Robert Blake murder trial urged jurors Wednesday to ignore his celebrity, then derided his acting abilities by saying he overplayed his role as a grieving spouse.
Schwartzbach said Blake's cries and moans the night his wife was killed were genuine, and dismissed as mistaken witnesses who suggested the actor was faking grief.
Blake, 71, is accused of murdering Bakley less than six months after their marriage.
Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.
Blake, 71, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Bakley.
