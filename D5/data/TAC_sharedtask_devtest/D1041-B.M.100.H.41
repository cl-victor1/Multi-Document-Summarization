Experts fear coral reefs may have been severely damaged by tsunami Divers help clear debris from tsunami-hit coral reefs in southern Thailand Places that had healthy coral reefs and intact mangroves were far less badly hit than places where the reefs had been damaged and the mangroves ripped out and replaced by beachfront hotels and prawn farms.
Thailand's largest coral clean-up operation intensified Saturday, with hundreds of divers rushing to clear tonnes of debris polluting world-class dive sites in the Andaman Sea before April monsoons.
The tsunami-battered Phi Phi islands southeast of Phuket island are probably the dirtiest.
