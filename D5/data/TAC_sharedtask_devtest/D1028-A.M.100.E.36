The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
The judge in the trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski turned down a series of defense requests for revisions in jury selection.
The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial on November 12.
