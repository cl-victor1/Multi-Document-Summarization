The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand jury.
Referring to the recent leaks and letters from acquaintances of the Ramseys, Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor, said, ``They are playing to the grand jury.'' The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
Romer made his decision after a police detective who investigated the slaying of the 6-year-old girl resigned and claimed Hunter bungled the Ramsey case.
