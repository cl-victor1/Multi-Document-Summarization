Ice glazes the 39-foot Tracie Leigh, the wind blowing stiff and cold, as Tom Lagana harvests oysters the old-fashioned way.
Standing on a square of deck covered with rock salt to keep it from freezing, he clutches 20-foot poles that work like giant chopsticks, spreading his arms wide, then pulling them back toward his chest.
A winch lifts the poles until tongs with metal claws open.
Mixed in with empty shells, muck and rocks lies the catch: a few dozen Chesapeake oysters.
For 25 years, Lagana has made a living harvesting Chesapeake Bay.
