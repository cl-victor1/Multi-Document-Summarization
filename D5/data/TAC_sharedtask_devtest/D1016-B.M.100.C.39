based on the facts unearthed by investigations on the possible misuse of state facilities and on Soeharto policies as chairman of the charity foundations, as well as based on testimony from experts and others, no sufficient proof was found to continue the probe.
The instruction implements People Consultative Assembly Decree No. which was passed by a special MPR session on November 13.
The House will only monitor its actions.
Ghalib told reporters here Wednesday.
he only questioned Soeharto from the legal side, not in political matters.
