In Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Central America, Africa, and Indonesia, fires have destroyed nearly 40 million forested acres, an area as large as New York state.
A three-year study in a remote Cameroon rain forest showed that the hornbill flies 100 miles or more when foraging for ripening fruit, in the process dispersing seeds through its droppings for nearly a quarter of the 59 species of trees in the forest.
The survival of the rain forest appears to rely to a large degree on the hornbills' ability to disperse seeds of so many species,'' said Thomas Smith, an associate professor of
