Sudan I, a potentially cancer-causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted hundreds of food items in Britain.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
"Because of the widespread use of this Worcester sauce to flavor other foods, we may find further affected products".
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) Monday extended the list of foods contaminated by carcinogenic colouring that it wants to recall from shop shelves and homes.
