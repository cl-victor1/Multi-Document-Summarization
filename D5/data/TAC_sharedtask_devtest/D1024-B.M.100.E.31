Sudan decided Friday to recall its diplomats in Washington to protest the U.S. air raid on a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Thursday.
After a cabinet meeting chaired by al-Bashir, Minister of Culture and Information Ghazi Saleh el-Din said the government has also decided to file compliants with the United Nations, the Arab League and other international organizations over the U.S. attack.
The U.S. launched missile attacks Thursday night on a pharmaceutical factory near the Sudanese capital Khartoum in retaliation for the bombings on August 7 against its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
