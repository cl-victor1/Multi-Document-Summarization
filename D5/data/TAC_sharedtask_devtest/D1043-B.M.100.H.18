The Lebanese parliament opened Monday a special session to vote on a no-confidence motion against the government over the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri two weeks ago.
"Out of concern that the government does not become an obstacle to the good of the country, I announce the resignation of the government I had the honour to lead," Karami told parliament in Beirut.
Hariri, who was opposed to Syria's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, was assassinated in a bomb blast in Beirut on Feb. 14.
