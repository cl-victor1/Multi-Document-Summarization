Linda Arndt, who was the only detective in John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years.
JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in the basement of her home.
On, a grand jury investigating the slaying was granted a six-month extension to complete its work.
Thomas resigned Aug. 6, accusing District Attorney Alex Hunter of bungling the case and trying to protect JonBenet's parents.
Its work is secret, but it's believed neither of JonBenet's parents has appeared before the panel.
