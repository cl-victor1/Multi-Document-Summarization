A parliamentary delegation headed Tuesday to a remote town in Pakistan's southwest Baluchistan province in a bid to end a siege by hundreds of armed tribesmen.
Renegade tribesmen have surrounded some 300 soldiers, government officials and their families sheltering at a paramilitary fort in the town of Dera Bugti, some 245 kilometres (152 miles) southeast of Quetta, since Sunday.
The fighting has raised fears of a repeat of an uprising that rocked the region in the 1970s, when thousands died.
Thousands of troops moved into the province following the attack, which killed eight people.
