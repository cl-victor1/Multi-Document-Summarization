JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her family's home Dec. 26, 1996, about eight hours after her mother discovered a ransom note demanding $118,000 for her safe return.
JonBenet's pediatrician also said he never suspected she was being abused.
JonBenet's parents have already provided police with DNA samples, largely snippets of hair.
Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
