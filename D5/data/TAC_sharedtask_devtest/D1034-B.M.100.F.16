Researchers confirmed 35 new species of frog in Sri Lanka's dwindling rain forest over the past decade but also found that 17 frog species have disappeared and 11 others face imminent extinction unless their habitat is protected.
Looking at more than 65 harlequin frog species that had vanished, researchers found that 80 percent of the time there was a correlation between higher temperatures and the species' disappearance.
Scientists studying a fast-dwindling genus of colorful harlequin frogs on misty mountainsides in Central and South America report Thursday that global warming is combining with a spreading fungus to kill off many species.
