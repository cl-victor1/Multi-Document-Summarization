A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormone dopamine on patients suffering from the degenerative nerve disorder Parkinson's disease, said a report out Thursday.
Doctors have been aware that dopamine levels worsen performance in some cognitive tasks while improving performance in others, without knowing why.
Parkinson's patients, when off their dopamine-increasing medications, learn better from negative feedback, such as being scolded, the study said.
And they learn less from positive feedback, such as being praised, than do healthy people of the same age and intelligence.
