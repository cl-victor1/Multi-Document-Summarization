The Lebanese parliament opened Monday a special session to vote on a no-confidence motion against the government over the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri two weeks ago.
The opposition groups have put the blame on Syria and the pro- Syrian Lebanese government for Hariri's death.
Saad Rafik Hariri will assume the historic responsibility and leadership of all national and political affairs.
Hariri's sister Bahia Hariri should be considered seriously as a candidate for the premiership, MP Boutros Harb told reporters Tuesday.
The announcement came ahead of parliamentary elections that should take place by the end of May.
