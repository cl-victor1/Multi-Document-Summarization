Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her home.
If Stancil moves forward with a trial, Fitzgibbons said he may be forced to ask the Hillsborough court to withdraw Lafave's guilty plea and fight his client's battle on two fronts.
The next, she was taking the boy to the rape crisis center for DNA tests on his clothes and fending off advances from national news shows.
