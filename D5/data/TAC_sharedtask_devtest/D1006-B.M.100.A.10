Health Canada has asked Pfizer for more safety data, Valois said.
Merck withdrew its Cox-2 drug, Vioxx, from the market last month, citing a study that found it increased the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of use.
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against Merck over Vioxx and one analyst believes it could cost the company up to $12 billion.
Bextra, Celebrex and Vioxx are all Cox-2 inhibitors.
The agency did not set a date for completing the review.
The Vioxx withdrawal caused Merck's third quarter profit to fall 29 percent.
