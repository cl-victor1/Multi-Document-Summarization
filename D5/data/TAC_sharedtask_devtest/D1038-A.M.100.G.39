Federal Aviation Authority officials told AFP..
Still, the eruption was nowhere near what happened 24 years ago, when 57 people were killed and towns 250 miles away were coated with ash.
Volcanologists must sift through competing plausible explanations for what they observe and what they do not.
But lookout points farther away were not considered to be in danger.
But unlike hurricanes, which allow meteorologists to make detailed observations by airplanes and satellites, a volcano eruption develops mostly out of sight, hundreds to thousands of feet underground.
