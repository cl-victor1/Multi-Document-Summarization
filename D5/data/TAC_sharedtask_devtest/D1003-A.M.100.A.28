The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province will be completed this year, the China Daily said.
Nature preserve workers in northwest China's Gansu Province have formulated a rescue plan to save giant pandas from food shortage caused by arrow bamboo flowering.
The Qinling pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about 50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said.
Arrow bamboo in two areas of the reserve which they inhabit is flowering, which means the plant will seed and die at the end of its life span.
