Brain tissue samples from a suspected US beef cow began its trip to England on Thursday for final tests to confirm if it is the second case of mad cow disease in the United States.
An Agriculture Department official is carrying the samples to the internationally recognized laboratory in Weybridge, England.
The laboratory confirmed the so far only US case of mad cow disease in December 2003.
"When we have all of the final results, we will share them very publicly," said Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns in a statement Thursday.
