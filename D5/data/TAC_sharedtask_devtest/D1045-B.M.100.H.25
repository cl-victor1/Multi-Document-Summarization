China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident, which led to a four-day water supply system shutdown as of the wee hours Wednesday in Harbin.
Benzene and nitrobenzene flew into the river following a blast at China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) Jilin Petrochemical company, a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province.
Razov urged Beijing to provide full information about the toxic spill, according to the ITAR-Tass and RIA Novosti news agencies.
Meanwhile, Russia's Ambassador to Beijing Sergei Razov met Saturday with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss the chemical threat.
