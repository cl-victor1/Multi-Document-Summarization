ATHENS, Greece -- A Cypriot passenger plane with 121 people on board crashed Sunday just north of the Greek capital, after being shadowed for 43 helpless minutes by fighter jets reporting that the co-pilot was slumped over the controls and that there was no sign of the pilot.
Before the plane crashed, the Greek fighter pilots reported seeing two people trying to take the controls in the cockpit.
A senior official at the Public Order Ministry speculated that a sudden drop in cabin pressure could have caused the disaster.
Oxygen masks also seem to have been activated in the plane.
