Two former chiefs of South Korea's state intelligence agency were to be arraigned in court Tuesday on charges they oversaw the agency's illegal wiretapping of phone conversations of influential figures.
Also facing trial are Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National Intelligence Service successively between December 1999 and April 2003, for allegedly supervising illegal mobile phone taps of the country's leading figures.
Samsung and the spy agency have apologized to the nation over the scandal.
In the conversation, the two allegedly discussed providing illicit funds to candidates in the 1997 presidential race won by Kim Dae-jung.
