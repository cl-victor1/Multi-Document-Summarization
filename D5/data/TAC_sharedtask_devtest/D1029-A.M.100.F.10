Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui, which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor at the installation.
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov. Awais Ahmed Ghani said.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
