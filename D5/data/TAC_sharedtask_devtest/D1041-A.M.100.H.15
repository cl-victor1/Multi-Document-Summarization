The oil spill has blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area, causing an ecological disaster that will take the sensitive ecosystem years from which to recover.
Already stressed from fishing and tourism, many of the reefs may be covered in mud, which can block sunlight that fish and other organisms below them need.
Australia this year put as much as a third of both its Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef marine park off limits to fishing.
Coral could also have been damaged by exposure to the air as water was sucked back from the shore before the tsunamis hit.
