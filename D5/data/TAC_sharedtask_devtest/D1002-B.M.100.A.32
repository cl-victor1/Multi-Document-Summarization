The five-member panel of the Supreme Court Appellate Divisionruled that "this case cannot be tried in Bronx County, or anywhereelse in the City of New York, without an atmosphere in which jurorswould be under enormous pressure to reach the verdict demanded bypublic opinion." "If you're a police officer in the Bronx, how come you can't betried in the Bronx where you have arrested people and had themtried," Sharpton said, adding later, "They cannot disenfranchisea whole county." A normalperson who gets arrested in the Bronx would not get a trial outsidethe Bronx.
