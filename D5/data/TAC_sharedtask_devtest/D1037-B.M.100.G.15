The Maryland Department of Natural Resources estimates that the clam harvest has dropped from 680,000 bushels at its peak in 1965 to fewer than 1,000 bushels last year.
Now officials in Maryland and Virginia are considering a radical approach to saving the oyster fishery and, they say, perhaps the bay itself: introducing an Asian oyster that appears resistant to the two parasites that have killed off so many of its Chesapeake cousins.
She said that the office plans to separate reports on the bay's health from reports on restoration efforts, which use computer modeling to predict likely outcomes.
