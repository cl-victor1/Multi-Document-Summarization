Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by the same form of the toxic chemical dioxin as the one found in a 1976 disaster at a factory in Seveso, Italy, an Austrian doctor said Monday.
Yushchenko was leading in Ukraine's presidential race.
In response, Ukraine's prosecutor general, Svyatoslav Piskun, announced that a criminal investigation into the poisoning was being reopened.
Western experts say the dioxin findings all but prove that Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned.
On December 11, Zimpfer had told a press conference that Yushchenko was suffering from dioxin poisoning and that this may have been intentionally done.
