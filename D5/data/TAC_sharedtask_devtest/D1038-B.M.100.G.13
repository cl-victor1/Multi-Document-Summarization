For the fifth straight day, Mount St. Helens let out a burst of steam and ash on Tuesday, similar to the earlier bursts that have risen out of the crater and perhaps larger.
That, in effect, took the lid off the magma underground, and later that day, Mount St. Helens erupted explosively.
US authorities on Wednesday lowered the eruption alert around the Mount St. Helens volcano, saying that an explosion of the simmering peak was no longer imminent.
In 1980, once scientists knew that powerful earthquakes were stirring Mount St. Helens, few people were visiting the mountain.
