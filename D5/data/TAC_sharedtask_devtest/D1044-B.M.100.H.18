The cancer-causing food coloring Sudan I has been found in other Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) products in China, state media said Monday, as the vastly popular fast food giant suspended sales.
Sudan-I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
China launched a food safety inspection when Sudan I was detected in a pepper sauce produced by a subsidiary of American company Heinz, Heinz-Meiweiyuan Food Co., Ltd. in southern China's Guangzhou city earlier this month.
KFC and China's food safety officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
