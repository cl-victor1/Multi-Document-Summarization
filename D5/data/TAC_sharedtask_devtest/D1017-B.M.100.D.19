Hurricane Floyd vented its fury on the Bahamas on Tuesday toppling trees and power lines, stripping roofs off homes and shoving a roiling sea into streets.
Authorities urged nearly 2 million people to evacuate coastal areas stretching from Florida to North Carolina today as Hurricane Floyd, one of the most powerful and biggest storms to ever threaten the United States, roared through the Bahamas.
Hurricane Floyd grew into a Category 5 storm with 250 kph winds and headed toward the Bahamas Monday, threatening the Florida coast of the United States, U.S. forecasters said.
