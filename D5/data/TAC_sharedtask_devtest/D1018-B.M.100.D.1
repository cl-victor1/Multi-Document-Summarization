Police took a jailed Dutch teenager Saturday to retrace his steps at the beach where he says he last saw Natalee Holloway the morning she disappeared in Aruba.
Police took Joran van der Sloot, 17, to a beach near the Marriott Hotel where he has admitted to being alone with the 18-year-old Alabama woman in the early hours of May 30, said police superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
Van der Straaten declined to provide further details, saying only that it was "part of the investigation".
Police have taken van der Sloot to the site before.
