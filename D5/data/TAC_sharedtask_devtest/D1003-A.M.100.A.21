By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China.
Currently more than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China.
Nature preserve workers in northwest China's Gansu Province have formulated a rescue plan to save giant pandas from food shortage caused by arrow bamboo flowering.
More than 20 million hectares of forest have been brought under protection and 3.61 million hectares of forest have been planted since 1997.
