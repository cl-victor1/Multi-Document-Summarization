Under the plea, Lafave would have been required to register as a sex offender, to forfeit her teaching certificate, submit to warrant-less searches, and wear an electronic monitoring device when the court requires it.
A similar sentence had been expected in the plea agreement in Marion County to which prosecutors and defense attorney John Fitzgibbons had agreed.
Lafave was charged in 2004 with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition after she allegedly had sex with the student in a sport utility vehicle while another teenager drove.
