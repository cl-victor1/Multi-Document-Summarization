BEIRUT, Lebanon Opposition leaders on Monday held Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, demanded Syrian troops withdraw from Lebanon within the next three months and called on the international community to intervene to help "this captive nation." It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder.
