The Dutch government has declared war on Islamic extremism following the brutal killing of filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh by a suspected radical Muslim, which brought the threat of Islamic violence close to home.
Van Gogh, the 47-year-old great great nephew of 19th-century painter Vincent van Gogh, was shot and stabbed to death on Tuesday while cycling near is home in Amsterdam.
A controversial figure and arch provocateur, van Gogh criticised everything he felt was "politically correct" through his films and articles and launched equally scathing verbal attacks on Muslims and Jews.
