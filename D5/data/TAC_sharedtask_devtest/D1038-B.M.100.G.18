The volcano killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980 after weeks of quakes, slides and tremors and after belching smoke, steam and ash.
The earthquakes began Sept. 23, when Mount St. Helens began to revive, and gradually increased in intensity and pace, culminating in an eruption a cloud of steam and ash on Friday, the first eruption since 1986.
Scientists say that even if their predictions, which have led them to issue a "code red" alert for an imminent eruption of the mountain, come true, any further eruptions would be far less devastating than the explosion of 1980.
