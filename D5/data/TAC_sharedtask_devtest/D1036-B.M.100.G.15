The opposition leader declined to comment on assertions from several of his allies that Russian intelligence agencies had a hand in his poisoning in September, which kept him from the campaign trail and disfigured his face weeks before a first-round presidential election.
About an hour and a half later, he had a business dinner with the SBU chief and one of his deputies, which lasted until around 3:30 am.
(Officially, the cases are unrelated; Satsyuk resigned his SBU post after a court ruled he could not hold both an executive position in government and a seat in the legislature.)
