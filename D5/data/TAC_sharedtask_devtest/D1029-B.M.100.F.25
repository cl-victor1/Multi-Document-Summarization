Armed police commandos were deployed on trains traveling in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province on Wednesday, a day after bombings damaged a portion of a rail track and wounded three policemen, an official said.
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf has warned the tribesmen not to push his government too far, saying the consequences will be severe.
Baluchistan has seen a wave of small bombings and rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen angered by government plans to build new military garrisons in the province.
Thousands of government officials, their families, and women and children of local tribesmen have fled Dera Bugti.
