Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
Two committees have been formed by the public to investigate the Soeharto clan's wealth.
A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto, Ghalib said without mentioning time and place for the questioning.
