China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident, which led to a four-day water supply system shutdown as of the wee hours Wednesday in Harbin.
The Chinese Ministry of Water Resources has ordered two reservoirs along the Songhua River to discharge more water downward to dilute the benzene slick on the river in northeast China, a ministry source said Friday.
The pollution slick, stretching more than 80 km, is flowing pass Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang Province, and is expected to reach Heilongjiang River in a matter of 12 days.
