The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter appointed Bruce Levin and Mitch Morrissey, in part, because of criticism he has mishandled the Ramsey case.
``Given all the recent questions...
public confidence demanded absolutely that we have the most experienced prosecutor we could get,'' said Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Hunter.
Levin and Morrissey together have 32 years of experience prosecuting homicide cases .
