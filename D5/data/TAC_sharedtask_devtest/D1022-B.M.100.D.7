The commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, but countries such as Japan and Norway still catch hundreds of whales each year and are hoping for international support for plans to substantially expand their hunts.
Earlier this month, the WWF conservation group laid into the hunt, saying the science it relied on would not pass peer review by scientists associated with any reputable journal.
We have made this known by communique today.
A majority would give countries broad authority to set the commission agenda.
