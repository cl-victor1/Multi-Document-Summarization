Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker and writer who had recently made a television film critical of Islam, was shot and stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street on Tuesday.
Van Gogh's killer was said to have had contacts with the group and allegedly stayed at each of the five homes searched.
Van Gogh's film added to that debate after it was broadcast in September.
After it became known that van Gogh's alleged killer was of Moroccan descent, politicians and commentators feared ethnic tensions and called for calm.
Dutch Muslim groups condemned the killing and called for reconciliation.
