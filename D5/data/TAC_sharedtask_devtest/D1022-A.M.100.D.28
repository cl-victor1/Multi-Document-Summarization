Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said in the submission given to the court in January that the government had no right to enforce its law on Japan because Tokyo did not recognise Australia's claim of territorial sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory.
Japan announced in April it plans to seek permission to extend its research whaling program in the Antarctic when the IWC meets later this month.
Tokyo will reportedly tell the IWC at a meeting starting this month in South Korea that it intends to nearly double its annual catch of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean, currently set at 440.
