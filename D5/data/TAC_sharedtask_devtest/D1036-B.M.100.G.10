Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by the same form of the toxic chemical dioxin as the one found in a 1976 disaster at a factory in Seveso, Italy, an Austrian doctor said Monday.
In response, Ukraine's prosecutor general, Svyatoslav Piskun, announced that a criminal investigation into the poisoning was being reopened.
The investigation has been reopened by the new general prosecutor, with support from the SBU.
Kalugin speaks from unusually direct experience.
Western experts say the dioxin findings all but prove that Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned.
The Russian leadership issued an order to assassinate the former Chechen leader.
