John Hathcock, of the Washington, D.C.-based dietary supplement industry group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said the industry does not oppose warning labels, but he dismissed suggestions that ephedra products ought to be sold by prescription only.
Ephedra is considered a ``dietary supplement'' and therefore is not controlled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Hundreds of dietary supplement products contain ephedra, which is extracted from the Chinese plant ma-huang and then manufactured into capsules, liquids or powders.
But even nasty side effects don't faze us.
A 35-year-old apparently healthy ephedra user collapsed during aerobics class with a stroke.
