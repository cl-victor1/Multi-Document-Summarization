NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy left the courthouse without comment.
They have all pleaded innocent to second-degree murder.
The judge rejected defense arguments that public outcry and intense media coverage following the shooting put undue pressure on the grand jury to issue the murder indictments.
The officers were indicted in March.
They are accused of firing 41 times at Amadou Diallo while searching for a rape suspect on Feb. 4.
