Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. issued that order in denying a news media motion to make juror names public.
The length of the trial, which is expected to last up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the trial to another city.
