President Clinton will visit Littleton, Colo., May 20 to meet with Columbine High School students to discuss the April 20 massacre that left 14 students and one teacher dead.
Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School on Monday.
Manes was the first person since the massacre 13 days ago to be arrested and accused of helping gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold arm themselves.
This year's Columbine High School yearbook features a special insert honoring the victims of the massacre at the school.
``Students are trying to do what they can to make the Columbine students feel comfortable.''
