TAMPA - The criminal case against Debra Beasley Lafave, the former Temple Terrace teacher who gained worldwide notoriety after being accused of sexually assaulting a student, ended Tuesday as bizarrely as it began.
But Debra Lafave was 23 and a bombshell, all blond hair, blue eyes and cheekbones.
In it, Debra Lafave gets three years of house arrest and seven years of probation, and is registered as a sex offender.
Circuit Judge Hale Stancil on Thursday turned down a plea agreement that would allow Debra Lafave, 25, to avoid a prison sentence.
All because of Debra Lafave.
