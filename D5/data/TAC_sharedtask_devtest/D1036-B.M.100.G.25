Two Russian secret agents assassinated a former president of Chechnya (whom Moscow called a terrorist) in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar in February by blowing up his car as he drove away from a mosque.
Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
Yushchenko had told reporters that he suspected that he swallowed the poison during a dinner he had with SBU chief Ihor Smeshko and his deputy.
