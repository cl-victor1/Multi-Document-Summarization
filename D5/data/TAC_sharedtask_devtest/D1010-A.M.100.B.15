Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food Sanitation, noted that although there was only a single case of mad cow disease found in the United States, the actual situation in the United States has to be evaluated.
The person, was not identified publicly, was discovered to have variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), which causes personality change, loss of body function, brain deterioration and eventually death, officials from the health ministry said.
Mad cow sprang up in Britain in 1986 and spread through Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and devastating the European beef industry.
