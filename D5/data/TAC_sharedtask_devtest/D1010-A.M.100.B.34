The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in the brains of cattle.
It is the second case since March in which the disease, known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, has been confirmed in a cow that died rather than having been slaughtered.
