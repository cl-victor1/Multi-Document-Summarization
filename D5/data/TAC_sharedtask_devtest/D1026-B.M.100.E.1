There's a new way for visitors to tour the nation's capital, and it doesn't involve walking, riding a bus or taking a yellow, motorized "duck boat".
Washington tourists can now see the city by riding a Segway, a two-wheeled, self-balancing scooter that -- if you haven't see one already -- looks a lot like a futuristic chariot.
City Segway Tours, a company that began in 2003 in Paris, offers tourists in Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, Vienna, Austria, and now Washington a different way to see the sights.
