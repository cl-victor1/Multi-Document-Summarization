Drug companies rushing to fill the vacuum left by Merck & Co.'s withdrawal of its best-selling arthritis drug Vioxx are flooding the airwaves with competing advertising claims that are bewildering many patients.
Over-the-counter pain-relief competitors like Advil, Aleve, and Tylenol have turned up the volume on TV, radio, and in print advertising that speaks directly to Vioxx fears in an attempt to grab a larger slice of the market.
Pfizer Inc., the maker of two competing prescription drugs that are in the same class as Vioxx -- Celebrex and Bextra -- also has launched a big ad campaign.
