The Swiss Foreign Ministry announced Thursday that it has agreed to a United Nations request to help investigate the Feb. 14 Beirut bombing which killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.
The pro-Syria Karami government resigned Monday under huge anti- Syrian pressure, one political fallout of Hariri's killing on Feb. 14 by a massive bombing attack in central Beirut.
A UN team dispatched to investigate the bombing completed its mission in Beirut on March 16 and is expected to announce initiative result on Thursday at the UN headquarters in New York.
Four bomb attacks occurred
