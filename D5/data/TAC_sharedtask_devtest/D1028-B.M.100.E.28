-- Theodore J. Kaczynski pleaded guilty Thursday to all the Federal charges against him, acknowledging that he was the Unabomber who killed and maimed people with package bombs in a solitary 18-year campaign aimed at bringing down the technological system.
David Kaczynski and his wife have been given a $1 million reward from the Justice Department for turning in David's older brother, Theodore, as the Unabomber.
The trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers, reportedly to air complaints about his defense, media reports said.
