A complicating factor in the clinical trials is the nature of Parkinson's, a disease that chokes off the supply of dopamine, a signaling chemical, in the brain.
Amgen executives said that there was already an approved therapy, deep brain stimulation, that could help alleviate the symptoms of the patients from the clinical trials.
The researchers extracted embryonic stem cells capable of releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter, from fertilized eggs of cynomolgus monkeys.
Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to the intractable disease.
