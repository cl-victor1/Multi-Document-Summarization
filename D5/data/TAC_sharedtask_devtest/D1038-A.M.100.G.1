A tremor shook Mount St. Helens for 25 minutes early Sunday, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption two days after the volcano came back to life.
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the volcano, which killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980, was shaken by a "tremor burst" for 25 minutes.
Eathquakes are rumbling at a rate of one or two per minute, it added.
Scientists on Saturday saw an increase of fumaroles, a hole from which hot gases and vapors emanate, in St. Helens' lava dome and detected carbon dioxide, the USGS said.
