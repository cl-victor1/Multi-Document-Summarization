The hostages,who were abducted by Abu Sayyaf in a resort in Sipadan, Malaysia,Sunday night, are now in the Philippines' Sulu Province.
Calimim said he assured them that the government will exert all efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as possible, but he refused to give a timetable.
Announcing he would meet with the rebel captors Friday, Misuari said the kidnappers saw the hostages as a treasure, and were unlikely to release them quickly.
The hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and a Filipino.
