The National Zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth early Saturday morning to a squealing cub the size of a stick of butter, and keepers say she is caring for it tenderly.
Southwestern Sichuan Province has closed 78 mines and polluting companies in the giant panda's habitat to provide a better home for the endangered species.
About 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild in their native China and another 200 live in captivity there.
Bai Yun will likely give birth to her third cub in about 4 1/2 months, said Don Lindburg, the zoo's giant panda conservation team leader.
