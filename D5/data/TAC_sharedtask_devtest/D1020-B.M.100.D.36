Consumption of food that contains listeria can cause listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
The company supplies meat for restaurants and institutions across the United States.
``We have genetic fingerprints that link E. coli 0157:H7 in samples of the meat from Rochester Meats to the patients in Maine who have become ill,'' said Beth Gaston, spokesman for the Agriculture Department's food safety and inspection office.
Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich. recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and deli meats in December because of possible contamination with listeria.
