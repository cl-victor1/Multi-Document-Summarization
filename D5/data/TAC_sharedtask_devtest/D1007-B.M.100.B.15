Another report in the Macao Daily News said on Sunday that the imports of pigeons and geese have increased by more than 10 percent.
Haunted by fears of the deadly virus, many local residents have turned to pigeons, geese and pork as substitutes for chickens, prompting a drop in the sales of chickens in Macao.
Sales of birds have dropped considerably in Macao, but officials said there is no plan to stop importing birds from China's inland.
To date, the total number of confirmed cases of bird flu in Hong Kong remains 13 and that of suspected cases is six.
