"Sudan I can contribute to an increased risk of cancer but at the levels present the risk is likely to be very small," the agency said in a statement.
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) Monday extended the list of foods contaminated by carcinogenic colouring that it wants to recall from shop shelves and homes.
