Is this a murder, or is this a terrorist attack?
The prosecutor charged seven suspects with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in a conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but late Friday a judge ruled that two of the suspects should be released.
Police said the suspect, a 26-year old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality who was arrested shortly after the murder, had links to Islamic extremists.
Both Wilders and Hirsi Ali are under police protection.
