Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
A previously unknown Islamic group on Monday claimed responsibility for an earlier killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri due to his ties with Saudi Arabia, the Qatar-based al-Jazeera TV channel reported.
Hariri had an Atlanta connection, quietly coming each year to Emory Medical Center for a checkup.
Syria has been under international pressure to withdraw its troops from Lebanon and not to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs.
