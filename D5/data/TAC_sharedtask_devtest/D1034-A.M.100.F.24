Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
They determined that 32.5 % of amphibian species were threatened with extinction, compared with 12 % of birds and 23 % of mammals.
Frogs and other amphibians have been vanishing worldwide over the past few decades.
The new study has limitations.
The team did not measure individual animals for contaminants because archived samples cannot be reliably tested.
As a result, there could be other explanations
