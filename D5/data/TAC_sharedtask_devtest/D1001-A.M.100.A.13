Students returned to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls.
The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre.
Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan says stricter gun laws could not have prevented the deadly school shootings in Littleton, Colo. Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
