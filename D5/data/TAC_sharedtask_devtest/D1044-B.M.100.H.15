Beijing's food safety office announced Wednesday that not only the pepper sauce and the chili oil, but also all other flavoring products made by the Heinz-Meiweiyuan Food Co., Ltd. have been banned in the country's capital.
The red dye Sudan I has been found in a pepper sauce made by the Heinz Meiweiyuan Food Co. based in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong province, Xinhua news agency said.
The British food manufacturer at the centre of a health scare caused by food contaminated with a potentially cancer-causing dye said Wednesday it did not expect to lose money over the affair.
