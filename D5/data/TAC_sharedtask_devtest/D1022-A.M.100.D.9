New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue...
if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales." Japanese media reports have said it will seek nearly to double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, in the Antarctic and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists.
