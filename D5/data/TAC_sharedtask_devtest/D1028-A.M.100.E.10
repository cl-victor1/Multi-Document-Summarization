The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
Unabomber killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. issued that order today in denying a news media motion to make juror names public, according to news reports.
Kaczynski, who was arrested in April last year, has pleaded innocent to all charges.
