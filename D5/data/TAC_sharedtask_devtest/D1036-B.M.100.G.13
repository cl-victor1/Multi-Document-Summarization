Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
Yushchenko has previously voiced suspicions that he ingested the poison during a dinner with the chief of Ukraine's SBU intelligence services, Ihor Smeshko, and his deputy on September 5.
Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by the same form of the toxic chemical dioxin as the one found in a 1976 disaster at a factory in Seveso, Italy.
