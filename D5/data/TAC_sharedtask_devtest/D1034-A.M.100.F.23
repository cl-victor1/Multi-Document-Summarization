They determined that 32.5 percent of amphibian species were threatened with extinction, compared with 12 percent of birds and 23 percent of mammals.
But some are threatened for no apparent reason, according to researchers who carried out the three year Global Amphibian Assessment.
The report evaluated the status of all known species of amphibians critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction.
Cricket frogs, once abundant, declined dramatically around Chicago and other regions in the 1960s, and the scientists found that the times and places with high rates of hermaphrodites, also called intersexes, overlapped with when and where the frogs disappeared
