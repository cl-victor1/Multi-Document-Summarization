A fourth man, a tour boat disc jockey, was arrested Friday as the latest suspect in the case of missing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway.
Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18 _ were interrogated by police the next day and released.
Holloway, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours of May 30, the last day of a five-day vacation with 124 students celebrating their high school graduation.
Authorities have not released the results of the search, but Attorney General Caren Janssen has said that Paul van der Sloot is not under investigation.
