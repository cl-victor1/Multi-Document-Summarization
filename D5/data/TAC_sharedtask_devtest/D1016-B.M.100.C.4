Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has instructed Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib to take active and effective actions in fighting corruption, collusion and nepotism and to take legal measures against former president Soeharto soon.
"There must be a real reason from Soeharto's medical team to explain why Soeharto can't come to meet the Attorney General Office's call," Darusman stressed.
Last year, investigation into Soeharto was ceased by the then Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko due to "lack of evidences." The Attorney General's Office last Thursday announced that it would summon Soeharto on Monday for further investigation on alleged corruption.
