Animal advocates hoping to halt a Japanese whale hunt announced plans Tuesday to appeal a legal decision that bars the group from filing a lawsuit against the whaling company Kyodo Senpaku.
Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo to reconsider its position on whaling, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said.
Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
