A Florida teacher who admitted having sex several times with her 14-year-old student was freed Tuesday after prosecutors dropped sexual abuse charges to avoid calling the boy to the witness stand.
Hillsborough County prosecutor Mike Sinacore has said that the victim's family had anticipated a trial, but that the media attention prompted the boy's mother to push for a plea deal.
In a move that surprised many, Marion County Circuit Judge Hale R Stancil Thursday said he wanted to hear more evidence before signing on to a plea agreement Lafave had reached with Hillsborough prosecutors.
