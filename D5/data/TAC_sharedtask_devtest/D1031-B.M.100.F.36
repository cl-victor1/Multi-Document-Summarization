Besides the untold human misery, officials say the quake and giant waves wrought havoc on the marine ecosystem, tearing up coral reefs and wiping out mangrove forests and seaweed beds along the coast.
The Indian Ocean's dazzling coral and dense mangroves suffered a beating during the tsunami, but environmentalists say they also protected the coastline and saved lives by absorbing some of the waves' power.
The UN Environmental Programme said the quake and the waves had damaged 25,000 hectares (61,750 acres) of mangroves, some 29,200 hectares of coral reefs and 120 hectares of seagrass beds.
