The giant panda is one of the world most rare and endangered species, with an estimated some 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan in southwest China, and northwestern Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
If the situation worsens all the pandas in the reserve will have to be transferred elsewhere.
About 100 giant pandas in northwest China Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died.
