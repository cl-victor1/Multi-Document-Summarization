Circuit Judge Hale Stancil on Thursday turned down a plea agreement that would allow Debra Lafave, 25, to avoid a prison sentence.
How could a judge think of forcing a victim into a trial? A psychiatrist testified that the teen would be further victimized by the insanity of a trial.
If the case goes to trial, Lafave could face up to 45 years on the charges in Marion.
Hillsborough County prosecutor Mike Sinacore has said that the victim's family had anticipated a trial, but that the media attention prompted the boy's mother to push for a plea deal.
