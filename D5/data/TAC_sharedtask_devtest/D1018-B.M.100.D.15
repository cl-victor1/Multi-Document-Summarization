The Kalpoes and the younger van der Sloot were seen leaving a popular bar with Holloway, 18, on May 30, which was to be her last night in Aruba before flying home to Alabama.
Van der Sloot, the son of a judge in training in Aruba, faces no charges, and authorities can hold him until Sept. 4, when he must be charged or released.
While American police must have probable cause that a suspect was involved in a crime, in Aruba police can arrest and question suspects based on a mere reasonable suspicion.
