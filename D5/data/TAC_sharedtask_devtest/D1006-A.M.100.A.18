The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
Others within the agency suggested Graham's conclusion was too strongly worded, given the FDA had not added such warnings to Vioxx labels.
Last week, Gilmartin and Kim still said that none of the earlier Vioxx studies, by either the company or others, convincingly showed increased heart and stroke risk from the drug.
