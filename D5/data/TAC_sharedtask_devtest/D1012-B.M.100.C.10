The setback came as coroners confirmed that at least 24 people on board the Cypriot passenger plane, including its co-pilot and a flight attendant, were alive when the Boeing 737 aircraft crashed on a hillside north of Athens on Sunday.
Greek investigators, who have teamed up with American aviation experts, said Tuesday that the impact of the crash was so great that one of the black boxes critical for understanding what happened before the plane crashed was damaged.
Adding to the families' grief, rescuers at the crash site failed to locate any trace of three of the bodies.
