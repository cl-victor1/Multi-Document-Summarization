U.S. government officials were trying to trace a cow shipped to the United States from the same Canadian herd as an animal infected with mad cow disease.
More than 170,000 U.S. animals have been tested for the disease since officials discovered the lone U.S. case of mad cow disease in Washington state in December 2003.
