Students and citizens in the country have held various demonstrations, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court on charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism.
The investigation for the Soeharto case, he said, will be finished before the general election in June.
The Attorney General's Office last Thursday announced that it would summon Soeharto on Monday for further investigation on alleged corruption.
Some reports said the property of Soeharto and his family has reached about 20 billion U.S. dollars.
Muladi said Ghalib has also been asked to investigate the magazine's findings, considering that Soeharto had authorized him to do so.
