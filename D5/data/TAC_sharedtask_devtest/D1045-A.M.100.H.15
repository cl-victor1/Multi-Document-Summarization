He said the polluted water in the Songhua River, which reached Heilongjiang provincial capital Harbin on Thursday morning, is expected to flow into the Heilongjiang River (called the Amur River in Russia) on the Sino-Russian border in around 14 days judging from the current flow speed.
Songhua River will carry poisonous substances to Harbin, a major city in northeast China, at round 5:00 a.m. Thursday, an official said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
The Nov. 13 blast in Jilin, a city in Jilin province, caused massive amounts of benzene, a toxic, flammable liquid to flow into the Songhua River.
