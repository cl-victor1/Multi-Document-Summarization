The pepper sauce, Meiweiyuan, produced by the Guangzhou-based Heinz Meiweiyuan Food Co.
Ltd, was spotted after an inspection of 17 brands of condiments by the city's food safety office and the commerce bureau.
The dye, which was also at the center of a European health scare, was found in both KFC and Heinz products.
The recall follows news of fast food giant McDonald's withdrawing some products in Britain after the dye, believed to cause cancer, was found in some food products.
The Sudan 1 issue has been an upheaval for the business in terms of time and effort.
