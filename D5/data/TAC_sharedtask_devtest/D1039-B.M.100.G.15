Six other suspects accused of conspiring to murder Van Gogh were arrested shortly after the murder and have been charged with membership in a terrorist organization and conspiring to murder.
The killing of brash social commentator Van Gogh after the murder of populist anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002, drew outrage and fears that people will no longer dare to speak freely.
Van Gogh was widely known for his criticism of Islam and recently caused an uproar with a short film made together with Hirsi Ali linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.
