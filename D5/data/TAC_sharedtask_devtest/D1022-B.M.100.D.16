Pro-whaling countries led by Japan failed to muster a majority Monday at the annual whaling commission meeting, in a setback for their hopes to control its agenda and eventually overturn a nearly two-decade ban on commercial whale hunts.
Japan kills whales for what it describes as scientific research, but sells the meat.
Anti-whaling nations Australia, New Zealand and Britain on Monday tore apart Japan's proposal to expand its whale hunt, saying the practice had no scientific justification and should be consigned to history.
The IWC banned commercial hunts in 1986 because species were near extinction after centuries of whaling.
