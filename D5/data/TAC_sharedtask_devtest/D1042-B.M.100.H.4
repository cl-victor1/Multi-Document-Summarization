The judge, Col. James L. Pohl, ordered the mistrial after Spc.
Under an agreement with the prosecution, England pleaded guilty Monday to seven charges of abuse.
That prompted Pohl to dismiss Graner and call a 3 1/2 hour recess before entering a plea of not guilty for England on one count of conspiracy.
England was one the seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company charged in the abuse scandal.
England will then receive the lesser of the two sentences.
This was the third time in as many days the judge has halted the hearing because of questionable testimony.
