England, 22, on Monday admitted seven charges of abusing Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
Under an agreement with the prosecution, England pleaded guilty Monday to seven charges of abuse.
Graner, who is reported to have married another soldier charged in the scandal, Megan Ambuhl, is expected to testify Tuesday.
That prompted Pohl to dismiss Graner and call a 3 1/2 hour recess before entering a plea of not guilty for England on one count of conspiracy.
This was the third time in as many days the judge has halted the hearing because of questionable testimony.
