Chris Servheen, the grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said his agency has received more than 60,000 comments on the grizzly delisting plan.
"As long as there is a spirit bear, we're going the right way." The efforts to save the rain forest began a decade ago, as lumber companies that had already cut most of the old-growth forest around British Columbia, by far Canada's richest forestry province, began moving into the Great Bear.
Some environmental groups, including the National Wildlife Federation, support the move to remove the bear from the endangered list.
