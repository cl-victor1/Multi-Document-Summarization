Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing informed Russian Ambassador to China Sergey Razov here Saturday afternoon of the situation with the Songhua River's water pollution and measures taken by the Chinese government to tackle the issue.
The Songhua River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, suffered major water pollution as a result of a blast that had occurred in the China National Petroleum Corporation Jilin Petrochemical company on Nov.13.
The apology follows repeated demands from Russia for more information about the chemical spill and its threat to the Russian people.
World environmental protection equipment manufacturers should keep an eye out for that.
