JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Monday said he would ask former President Soeharto to sign a letter of authorization that would enable the investigation team to probe Soeharto's overseas wealth.
"With this letter of authorization, I can go anywhere in the world to search accounts that may be held by Soeharto," Ghalib was quoted by the newspaper The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
Without such a letter, it will be hard for the team to ask foreign banks to open their records due to long-established banking secrecy policies, he added.
