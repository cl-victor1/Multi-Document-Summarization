Combined, these factors have caused a stunning decline in Maryland oyster harvests: from about 2,600,000 bushels in 1974-75 to about 26,000 bushels last year.
The oysters were spawned at the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science, then planted in the managed reserves, where they grew under the supervision of scientists.
The Asian oysters are believed to be resistant to the diseases that have killed off native oysters in the Chesapeake.
In an earlier time, they would have been prepping their dredges for oyster season, but most won't be dredging this year.
