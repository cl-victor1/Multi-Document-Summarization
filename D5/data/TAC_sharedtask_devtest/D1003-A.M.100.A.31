Nature preserve workers in northwest China's Gansu Province have formulated a rescue plan to save giant pandas from food shortage caused by arrow bamboo flowering.
China has applied to the United Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.
Currently, more than 1,500 giant pandas live in the wild in the country, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
The giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
