Five years of planning, they say, have left the bay no cleaner than it was when the ``Chesapeake 2000'' pact was signed.
In its petition filed in December, the bay foundation noted that almost none of those sewage plants had permits that limited nitrogen pollution and asked the EPA to remedy that.
Both Virginia and Maryland have been spending several million dollars each year to restore native populations, and they are considering introducing a heartier nonnative species to the bay.
These pollutants, when washed downstream to the bay, feed algae blooms that suck oxygen out of the water.
