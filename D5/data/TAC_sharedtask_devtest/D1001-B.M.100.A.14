The U.S. police authorities Monday arrested a man suspicious of supplying the semiautomatic pistol used in the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado State.
The arrest came on the same day Columbine students returned to classes at another school, nearly two weeks after the massacre that left 15 dead.
