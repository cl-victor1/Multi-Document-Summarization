Animal advocates hoping to halt a Japanese whale hunt announced plans Tuesday to appeal a legal decision that bars the group from filing a lawsuit against the whaling company Kyodo Senpaku.
Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court last week to sue the Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
In rejecting the application, Judge James Allsop said Australia does not have a legal right to stop whaling in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction there.
