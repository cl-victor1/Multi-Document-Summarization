More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
Tamelander said many coral reefs in the Indian Ocean were just beginning to recover from damage caused by the changing water temperatures generated by the El Nino weather pattern.
"The coral reef system might be totally destroyed.
It will take hundreds of years to grow back," he said.
