Baluchistan has seen a wave of small bombings and rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen angered by government plans to build new military garrisons in the province.
The silver-bearded chieftain, who is about 80 and has led the Bugti tribe for decades, accuses the central government of pillaging Baluchistan's natural resources while locals live in poverty -- even though the country's main gas field is only 60 kilomters (35 miles) away.
Hours after the attack, Mir Azad Baluch, who often speaks for a nationalist group called Baluchistan National Liberation Army, contacted reporters in Quetta and claimed responsibility for the attacks.
