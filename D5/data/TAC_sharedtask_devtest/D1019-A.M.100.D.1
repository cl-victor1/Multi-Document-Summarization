SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Authorities hunted the seas between Malaysia and the Philippines today for two fishing boats controlled by heavily armed men holding 21 hostages they abducted from a Malaysian diving resort two days earlier.
The kidnapping might be tied to Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the United States, although some authorities said the Abu Sayyaf rebels were just trying to attract attention.
