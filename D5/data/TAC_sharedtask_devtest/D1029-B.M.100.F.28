Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged in January after rebels launched a deadly rocket barrage on a major gas plant in revenge for the rape of a female doctor.
Baluchistan has seen a wave of small bombings and rocket attacks blamed on tribesmen angered by government plans to build new military garrisons in the province.
Armed police commandos were deployed on trains traveling in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province on Wednesday, a day after bombings damaged a portion of a rail track and wounded three policemen, an official said.
