The avalanche came off a mountain at about 2,700m high in the Val di Roia, not far from the Italian border with Austria and quite close to the Austrian resort of Galtuer, where 38 people were killed by an avalanche on February 24.
Italian authorities said the avalanche was caused by the recent rise in temperatures in the area, warning that the risk of avalanche will be very high.
