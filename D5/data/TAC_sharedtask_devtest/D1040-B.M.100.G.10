Jurors in the murder case against actor Robert Blake deliberated for more than five hours Monday without reaching a verdict _ and without making any requests to review trial testimony or evidence.
In most of the murder plots Blake proposed, Hambleton said, the actor wanted to be present.
110 witnesses were called during the trial, 74 for the prosecution and 36 for the defense.
If convicted, the former "Baretta" star could be sentenced to life in prison.
Last Wednesday, jurors reviewed testimony by three people who saw Blake at the restaurant the night of the killing.
