The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
The three former friends, all residents of Boulder, have broken off their friendships with John and Patsy Ramsey, parents of the slain child.
On Thursday, Boulder's new police chief, Mark Beckner, urged the prosecutor to convene a grand jury for the case.
John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney.
