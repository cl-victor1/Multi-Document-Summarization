Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft now in Papua New Guinea on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies.
Papua New Guinea provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun said homeless survivors were in desperate need of food and shelter.
Other air force transport planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if requested by the Papua New Guinean government.
The condition of airstrips in the region was unknown and it was not known if the planes would be able to land.
