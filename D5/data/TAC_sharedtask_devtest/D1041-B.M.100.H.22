The tsunami that took a heavy toll in human life also battered Indian Ocean coral reefs that already were in distress from pollution and global warming, possibly causing damage that will require decades to recover, experts say.
The tsunami split coral reefs in India's remote Andaman and Nicobar islands chain, burying them under sand deposits and threatening the entire marine habitat in the area.
The Andaman coral reefs are a treasure trove of biodiversity, second only to Australia's Great Barrier Reef and comparable to the coral reefs near the Philippines and Indonesia.
