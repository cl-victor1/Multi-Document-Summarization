An appellate court ordered the trial of the four officers accused of killing Amadou Diallo to be moved to Albany County, ruling on Thursday that a fair trial would be impossible in the Bronx because of ``the public clamor'' about the case.
The decision by a state appellate court to move the criminal trial of four New York City police officers charged with the killing of Amadou Diallo to Albany County seems unjustified.
Another will be the question of how long it took the officers to fire 41 shots.
Diallo was black and the officers who shot him are white.
