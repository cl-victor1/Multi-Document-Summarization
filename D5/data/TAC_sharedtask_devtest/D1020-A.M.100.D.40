In a report the recall involved 556,226 pounds of ground beef produced at its plant in Dakota City, Nebraska.
More than 250,000 kilograms of ground beef in 33 U.S. states have been recalled because the meat might contain a deadly strain of E. coli.
The recall includes dozens of brand names, based on information collected by the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service and provided by the company.
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control had managed to trace 20 cases of food sickness to the Bil Mar plant by Dec. 18.
