Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said a special team has been set up by the police to rescue the hostages who were taken in boats by the pirates.
A rebel spokesman said two hostages, including a child, were injured in the shelling of the rebel camp, but the claim could not be independently verified.
The department's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told South African Press Association that the identity of the man and the woman have been known to the South African mission in Malaysia.
