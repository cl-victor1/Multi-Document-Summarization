Norwegian authorities authorized the oil company Statoil to partially resume production on two North Sea oil platforms that were shut down in late November because of a gas leak.
Norway's state-controlled oil company Statoil began a small amount of producti from its 205,000-barrel a day capacity Snorre A and Vigdis fields, following a Nov. 28 shutdown because of a natural gas leak.
Full production from the Snorre A and nearby Vigdis fields would restore about 205,000 barrels a day of production, or some 6.4 percent of this Nordic country's 3.2 million barrel per day capacity.
