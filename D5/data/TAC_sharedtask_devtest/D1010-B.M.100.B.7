The Department of Agriculture said, and repeated it the test a second time to be sure.
U.S. government officials were trying to trace a cow shipped to the United States from the same Canadian herd as an animal infected with mad cow disease, yet officials said.
As a preventive measure, the government ordered slaughter of all the 157 animals on that farm and their offspring with the same age as the infected cow.
The test results are expected to come out in about a week.
