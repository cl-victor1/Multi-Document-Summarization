Japan on Tuesday put its army, air force and navy on standby to provide assistance to survivors of Asia's tsunami disaster, with most of their work expected to be in worst-hit Indonesia.
Half of the assistance will be in the form of grants for short term relief and the remainder in loans for long term reconstruction, Howard said.
Nearly 500,000 people were made homeless after tsunami swept Aceh province, in Indonesia on Dec. 26, ministry of information and communication said on Wednesday.
A Chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged Indonesia early Friday to help emergency aid efforts there.
