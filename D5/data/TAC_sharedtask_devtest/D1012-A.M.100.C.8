A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people on board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that rapidly starved the pilots of oxygen, aviation experts said.
The Greek government on Sunday ruled out the possibility of a terror attack after a Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by the private Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, killing all 115 passengers and six crew members on board.
