The Helios Airways flight crashed Sunday, killing everyone on the plane.
Meanwhile, ambulances ferried more bodies from another morgue in an eastern Athens suburb, where the remains were taken after they were recovered from the slopes of a mountainous region north of Athens, where Helios Airways flight ZU522 crashed early Sunday afternoon.
The Helios jet crashed near the village of Grammatiko, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Athens, after the plane plunged 10,400 meters (34,000 feet) into a mountainous area.
If that happened, the Helios Airways jet may have been flying on autopilot long before it crashed, the experts said.
