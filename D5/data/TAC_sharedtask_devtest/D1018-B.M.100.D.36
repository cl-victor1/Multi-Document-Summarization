Paul van der Sloot, a judge in training in Aruba, gave his 17-year-old son Joran van der Sloot and two Surinamese brothers legal advice the day after 18-year-old Natalee Holloway disappeared, District Attorney Caren Janssen told MSNBC in an interview.
Joran van der Sloot has told his mother that he left the young woman there, alone and unharmed, and does not know what happened to her.
But Janssen said the elder van der Sloot had been arrested for being a suspect in the disappearance, not for obstructing the investigation.
