There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine students and Columbine Valley residents.
Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
To accommodate the 1,965 Columbine students, the school day is being split with Chatfield students beginning early in the day and Columbine students showing up shortly before 1 p.m.
Many looked for it Saturday morning on top of Mt.
Columbine, a hill in Clement Park that borders the high school's baseball fields.
The community outpouring has touched some Columbine students.
