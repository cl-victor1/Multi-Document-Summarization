LITTLETON, Colo.
(AP) -- This year's Columbine High School yearbook features a special insert honoring the victims of the massacre at the school.
Columbine students began picking up their yearbooks Monday.
The yearbook shows the senior pictures of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who killed 12 classmates and a teacher inside the school April 20 before taking their own lives.
It also has a special insert remembering the slain students and teacher.
Senior Megan Fasano was among the students who picked up a yearbook Monday night at a church near the still-closed school.
