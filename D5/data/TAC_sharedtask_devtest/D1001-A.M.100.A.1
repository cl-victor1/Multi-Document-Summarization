ARVADA, Colo.
(AP) -- Columbine High School junior Matt Wells took time out from the grieving world around him to crack a smile, chew on a wad of sunflower seeds and talk a little baseball.
``It's just good to be smiling and laughing,'' he said.
Wells, a 16-year-old catcher on Columbine's varsity baseball team, watched the junior varsity play Arvada West High School on Wednesday.
There were cheers and grins here, eight days after teen-age gunmen walked the halls of their school and killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.
