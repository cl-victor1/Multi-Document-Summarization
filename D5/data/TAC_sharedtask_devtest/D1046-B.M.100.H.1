The number of bodies found, buried and missing after Dec. 26 tsunami disaster reached 238,892 in Indonesia, according to a release from the Indonesian Ministry of Information and Communication here Thursday.
The rise of the figure is due to the finding of some 850 bodies in Banda Aceh, the capital city of the Aceh province, Aceh Besar district and west coastal areas in the western tip of the country.
