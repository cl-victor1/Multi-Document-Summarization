Arrow bamboo in two areas of the reserve which they inhabit is flowering, which means the plant will seed and die at the end of its life span.
Giant pandas will not eat the bamboo after it blooms and it takes 10 years for a new supply to grow.
The Qinling pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about 50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said.
China will soon finish building its first blood bank for pandas, which will assist researchers in studying the endangered animals' blood types and chances of accepting blood transfusions, state media said Friday.
