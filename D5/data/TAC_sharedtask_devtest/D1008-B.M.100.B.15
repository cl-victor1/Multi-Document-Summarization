A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
To understand the Chesapeake's troubles, you have to know that six major rivers and thousands of small creeks (in six states and the District of Columbia) flow into it.
They said it could shut down the annual St. Mary's County Oyster Festival, which brings in more than 15,000 tourists a year to watch the National Oyster Shucking Championship.
