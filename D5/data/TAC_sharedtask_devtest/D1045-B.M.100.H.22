The Chinese Ministry of Water Resources has ordered two reservoirs along the Songhua River to discharge more water downward to dilute the benzene slick on the river in northeast China.
Both the headquarters and their respective representative offices in China of the two agencies have been informed of the accident as well as measures the Chinese government has taken to tackle the pollution problem.
The Songhua River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, suffered major water pollution as a result of a blast that had occurred in the China National Petroleum Corporation Jilin Petrochemical company on Nov.13.
