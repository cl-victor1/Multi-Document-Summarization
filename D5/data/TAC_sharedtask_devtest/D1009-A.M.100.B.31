The district attorney in Colorado overseeing the JonBenet Ramsey homicide case on Friday appointed two new special prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury.
When John and Patsy Ramsey hired lawyers after their daughter, JonBenet, was killed and then distanced themselves from police, it didn't sit right with Nancy Gordon.
On Thursday, Boulder's new police chief, Mark Beckner, urged the prosecutor to convene a grand jury for the case.
Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter appointed Bruce Levin and Mitch Morrissey, in part, because of criticism he has mishandled the Ramsey case.
