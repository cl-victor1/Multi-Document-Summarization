The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 18: The decision by a state appellate court to move the criminal trial of four New York City police officers charged with the killing of Amadou Diallo to Albany County seems unjustified.
Sharpton stood beside Diallo's father, Saikou, and accused the state appellate court of moving the trial to Albany to ensure that a white judge and jury would be selected.
The trial was moved to Albany after defense attorneys argued that the officers could not get a fair trial in the Bronx.
Witnesses reported a sad, stunned aftermath.
