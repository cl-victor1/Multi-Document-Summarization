A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
The flight was headed from the Cypriot city of Larnaca to Athens International Airport After losing contact with the Athens airport's control tower, the Greek air force immediately sent two F-16 fighter jets to lead the airliner.
Sudden loss of cabin pressure would trigger a loud horn and caution lights, said John J. Nance, an air safety analyst and former Air Force and commercial pilot.
Reports said the crew notified Cypriot authorities of a fault
