Bakley, 44, was shot as she sat in a car near Blake's favorite restaurant, where they had dined on May 4, 2001.
Blake contends he was in the restaurant at the time, retrieving a handgun he carried for protection.
Gary McLarty, a former "Baretta" stuntman and admitted cocaine user, testified that Blake offered him $10,000 (euro7,608) and "insinuated" that he wanted Bakley dead.
The star of TV' ``Baretta'' said someone else shot his wife in his parked car when he returned to a Studio City restaurant to retrieve the Smith & Wesson revolver that he said he accidentally left behind
