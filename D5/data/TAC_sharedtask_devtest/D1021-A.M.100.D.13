A female teacher whose sexual liaisons with a 14-year-old middle school student made tabloid headlines has avoided prison time by pleading guilty to having sex with the boy in a classroom and at her home.
Nearly 18 months after her case sent the tabloids into a tizzy, Lafave pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors in Hillsborough and Marion County.
The biggest complication for Lafave could be a requirement that she place her name on the state's sex offender registry.
If she is guilty, she should go to prison.
