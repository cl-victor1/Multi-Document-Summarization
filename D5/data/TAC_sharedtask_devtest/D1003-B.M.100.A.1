Panda Gives Birth at National Zoo//(Washn) By Richard Simon=(c) 2005, Los Angeles Times= WASHINGTON -- The capital's newest celebrity isn't a Democrat or Republican.
It's a giant panda cub no bigger than a stick of butter.
The unnamed baby was born at the National Zoo early Saturday to Mei Xiang, one of two giant pandas that have become a popular Washington attraction, drawing about 1.5 million visitors a year.
Zoo officials said the newborn was doing fine and was secluded with its mother in the zoo's giant panda quarters, monitored around the clock by veterinary staff via cameras.
