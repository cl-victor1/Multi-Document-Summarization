A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with German practice, identified one of the pilots as a 58-year-old German but would not give his full name.
The plane might have run out of fuel after flying on autopilot, air force officials said, asking not to be named in line with Greek practice.
Many bodies of the 121 people aboard were burned in a brush fire sparked by the crash and will be identified in Athens by DNA comparison with close family members.
