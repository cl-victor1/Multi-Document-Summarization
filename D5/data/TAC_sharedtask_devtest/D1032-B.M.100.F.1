Norwegian safety officials harshly criticized Statoil ASA Thursday for a natural gas blowout at the oil company's Snorre offshore field in November, and ordered comprehensive improvements.
The national Petroleum Safety Authority said the entire oil industry must learn from Statoil's failings since the incident narrowly escaped being one of the worst catastrophes on the Norwegian continental shelf.
"With only marginally different circumstances the gas blowout at Snorre could have resulted in a major accident with the loss of many lives," said authority director Magne Ognedal.
