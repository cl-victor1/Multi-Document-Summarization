Officials, including Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who held a news conference Saturday afternoon in nearby Vancouver, WWash., said.
A day after the volcano spewed a plume of steam and ash thousands of feet into the air, there was a very brief steam release Saturday a puff of white cloud.
It was like a big burp.
The explosions shaved off 400 meters of the mountain top, reducing it from 2,950 meters to 2,549 meters.
