The patriarch of South Korea's largest family-run conglomerate, Samsung Group, offered 825 million dollars to charity on Tuesday and apologised for a spate of scandals which engulfed his company.
"We feel sorry for causing the concerns to the people, with issues such as political donations," Samsung vice chairman Lee Hak-Soo said from a statement on behalf of the group and chief Lee Kun-Hee.
The unconditional donation was part of efforts by the group and the family which controls Samsung to redeem themselves from the "wrongful practices of the past," he said.
It was the country's largest donation to charity ever.
