More than 40 percent of Kuwaiti women are obese and suffer from other chronic ailments such as vein-hardening, diabetes and hypertension, local press reported today, citing a Kuwaiti psychologist.
The study shows that the 12 percent obesity is close to the standard in developed countries.
Hypnotism has become a successful experiment to rid extra fat in obese men and women in Kuwait, a specialist said here today.
He said up to 700 obese people were satisfied with the results of hypnotherapy.
Kuwait has started this medical experiment on obesity cases recently.
