Prosecutors in one Florida county decided Tuesday to drop charges against a former Tampa teacher accused of having sex with a 14-year-old middle school student.
The decision, announced hours after a judge rejected a plea deal for Debra Lafave, means the victim will not have to testify.
Lafave's sentence in another county for having sex with the same boy still stands.
Prosecutors and defense attorneys had urged the judge to accept the deal for the sake of the boy involved.
