BEIJING, August 16 (Xinhua)-- China, a country taking pride in its traditional herbal medicine, is considering how to limit digging plants for such usage in grassland.
Digging for wild plants and herbs usually destroys grass growing around them, resulting eventually in the environmental destruction, according to today's China Daily.
If excessive digging continues, the great Hulunbuir Pasture which has a grassland of 149 million mu, or 9.98 million hectares, will become a desert within 10 years, the paper said.
Major herbal plants being dug for include liquor ice, Chinese ephedra, Chongcao (Chinese Caterpillar fungus) and Facai, a precious wild vegetable.
