As if on cue, Mount St. Helens on Tuesday morning spat up another towering cloud of steam and ash, just as it had the previous morning during a government news briefing about the volcano.
In 1980, a massive eruption of Mount St. Helens in southwestern Washington killed 57 people, dumped tons of ash on towns across the region and set off one of the most powerful landslides in history.
Mount St. Helens has calmed down and is no longer likely to erupt at any moment, the U.S. Geological Survey announced Wednesday.
