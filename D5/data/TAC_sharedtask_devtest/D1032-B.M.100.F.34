The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field, which was shut down by a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
The safety authority has called the gas leak from a production well one of the most serious incidents ever on the Norwegian continental shelf.
No one was injured, but the leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew from Snorre A platform.
The incident shut down 205,000 barrels of day of oil production from the Snorre A and Vigdis platforms, or 6.4 % of this Nordic country's 3.2 million barrel
