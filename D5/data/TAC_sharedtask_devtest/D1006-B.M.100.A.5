The Food and Drug Administration told Merck & Co. that it requires further safety and efficacy data before it will approve its successor drug to now defunct pain reliever Vioxx, the pharmaceutical maker announced Friday.
Dr. David Campen, Graham's co-author on the Vioxx study and a top medical director at Kaiser Permanente, which provided data for the Vioxx study, supported Graham's view of events, including the proposal for a new study.
Vioxx is a member of a class of painkillers called COX-2 inhibitors, which also includes the Celebrex and Bextra drugs made by Pfizer Studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
