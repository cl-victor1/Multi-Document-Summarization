Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her home.
Prosecutors and defense attorneys tried to convince a judge to accept a plea deal that would prevent the case of a teacher accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student from going to trial.
They had anticipated a trial all along, but the media attention prompted the boy's mother to offer a deal.
