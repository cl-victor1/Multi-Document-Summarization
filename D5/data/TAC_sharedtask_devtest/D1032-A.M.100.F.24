Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Wednesday that it remained "unclear" when it would be able to resume production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier this week.
Its satellite platform Vigdis, whose production transits Snorre, was closed.
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
The Snorre oil field where the Snorre A and Snorre B platforms are located produces a total 238,000 barrels
