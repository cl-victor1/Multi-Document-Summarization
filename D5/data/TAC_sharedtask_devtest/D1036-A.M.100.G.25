The Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office announced Sunday it had reopened an investigation into allegations that presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned, after doctors in Austria confirmed he had ingested dioxin.
Ukraine has been in a political crisis since the Nov. 21 presidential election, victory in which has been claimed by both pro-Moscow candidate, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, and pro- Western candidate, opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko.
Yushchenko cited the suspicious but unexplained deaths of several prominent figures, including Vyacheslav Chornovil, a former presidential candidate who died in a traffic accident several years ago.
