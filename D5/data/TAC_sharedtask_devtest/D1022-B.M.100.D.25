Whaling nations are set for a showdown with their critics in South Korea next week, and frustration on both sides is threatening to scupper an international agreement designed to protect whale stocks.
The United States again is urging Japan to end its program of killing whales, which the Japanese say is for scientific research, and told Japan any expansion of the program would be unacceptable, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
Australia, New Zealand and other anti-whaling states say Japan exploits a loophole in the 19-year-old ban on commercial whaling to hunt the giant mammals for food.
