In some spots in India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, thick mangrove forests similarly softened the hammer blow of the tsunami for villages just inland, authorities reported.
Besides the untold human misery, officials say the quake and giant waves wrought havoc on the marine ecosystem, tearing up coral reefs and wiping out mangrove forests and seaweed beds along the coast.
"There has to be a mangrove replanting to make the fish sanctuaries recover," he said, suggesting the UN or other aid agencies pay the more than half a million fishermen now out of work to restore the mangrove swamps.
