Japan announced in early April it intends to seek permission to conduct broader, more comprehensive research whaling program in Antarctic at commission's annual meeting in South Korea in mid-June.
Judge James Allsop based rejection on submission to court by Canberra saying government cannot legally stop whaling company hunting in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction over waters.
Jeanette Fitzsimons told NewZealand's National Radio she had discussed with Australian Green Party leader Brown's idea of some trans-Tasman consumer action against Japan if they succeed in getting approval from International Whaling Commission for expanded whale hunt.
