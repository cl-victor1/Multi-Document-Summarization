An appellate court ordered the trial of the four officers accused of killing Amadou Diallo to be moved to Albany County, ruling on Thursday that a fair trial would be impossible in the Bronx because of ``the public clamor'' about the case.
The Rev. Al Sharpton continued to protest the decision to transfer the trial of the four white police officers accused of shooting Amadou Diallo to Albany, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela appeared with him Saturday and condemned police brutality.
Another will be the question of how long it took the officers to fire 41 shots.
