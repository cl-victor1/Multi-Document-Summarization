An Air Force study of veterans who sprayed Agent Orange during the Vietnam War found the strongest evidence to date that exposure to the herbicide is associated with diabetes, officials said today.
In its most clear-cut acknowledgment that there is evidence linking Agent Orange to illness among Vietnam veterans, the Air Force said in a new report that there was ``particularly strong evidence'' tying the defoliant to the onset of diabetes in veterans who were involved in spraying it over the Vietnamese countryside.
Dioxin is the component of Agent Orange linked to many health effects in laboratory animals.
