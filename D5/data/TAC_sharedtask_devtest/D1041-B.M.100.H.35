Coral reefs have been similarly hit by waste water from new developments, dynamite fishing and warmer water because of climate change.
"Coral reefs act as a natural breakwater and mangroves are a natural shock absorber, and this applies to floods and cyclones as well as tgroves suffered fewer human casualties and less damage to property compared to areas without mangroves," the British-based science website SciDev.Net says.
Coral reefs also may suffer more diseases and even death from the silt and sand that chokes the tiny organisms that builds the reefs.
