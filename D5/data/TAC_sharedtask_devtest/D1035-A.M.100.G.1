Dr. Le Cao Dai, one of Vietnam's top experts on the health effects of Agent Orange, first encountered American military herbicides when he ran a field hospital for the North Vietnamese army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
American planes would fly low over the forest canopy and release a cloud of chemicals.
Within days, the leaves would begin to fall, forcing Dai to move his hospital deeper into the forest for concealment.
Only later did he come to believe that the spraying had done long-term health damage to Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.
