TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- The 21 hostages suffered from hunger and diarrhea, and some pleaded for water.
One said she could not walk and wept in a bamboo hut where she and the others are being held by Muslim rebels.
The hostages, including 10 foreign tourists, beamed Monday when a doctor and several journalists arrived at the hut, 45 minutes from the nearest road in the hills of a southern Philippine island.
About 50-70 heavily armed Abu Sayyaf rebels, their faces covered with hoods, guarded the area on Jolo island in the southern Philippines.
