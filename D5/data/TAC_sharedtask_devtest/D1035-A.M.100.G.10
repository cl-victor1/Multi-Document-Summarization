Benefits for Vietnam War veterans are not likely to be affected by an independent review that confirms ties of Agent Orange to several diseases without resolving lingering questions about birth defects or diabetes.
The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
According to U.S. records, the United States sprayed about 12 million gallons (45 million liters) of Agent Orange over parts of southern and central Vietnam in 1961-71.
