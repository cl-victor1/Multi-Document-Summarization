A $19.4 million plan to reduce pollution and restore bay grasses and oyster habitat to the Corsica River was announced by Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. Tuesday as a ``blueprint'' for saving the Chesapeake Bay.
``We have written to you in the past appealing for help for the Chesapeake Bay and urge you, once again...
to make the Bay's restoration a top priority.'' The cleanup, led by Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C., along with nearly a dozen federal agencies, is known as the Chesapeake Bay Program .
