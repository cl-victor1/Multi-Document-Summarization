ST.
LOUIS (AP) -- Just down the block from biotech ground zero -- the headquarters of Monsanto Co., which helps produce biotech foods -- the Beddos shopped for groceries.
Israel Beddo had heard about Kraft recalling taco shells because of a particular type of bioengineered corn, but didn't think much about it.
His wife, Krista, on the other hand, was well aware of the issue as she held their one-year-old daughter.
''I think they ought to leave nature alone,'' she said.
''There is a reason food grows like it does''.
