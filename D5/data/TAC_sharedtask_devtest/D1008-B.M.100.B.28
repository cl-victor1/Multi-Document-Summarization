The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
In desperation, the two bay states have turned to the Chinese oyster, which has been grown for about 30 years in Oregon and is believed to be immune to the Chesapeake's oyster diseases.
They said it could shut down the annual St. Mary's County Oyster Festival, which brings in more than 15,000 tourists a year to watch the National Oyster Shucking Championship.
