Judge Darlene Schempp dismissed the charge, ending Blake's four year criminal court odyssey that took him from movie star to murder suspect and saw him jailed for a year following his April 2002 arrest.
After a 12-week trial that ended with jurors saying they did not believe two Hollywood stuntmen central to the prosecution's case, actor Robert Blake was found not guilty Wednesday of fatally shooting his wife.
Deputy District Attorney Shellie Samuels told jurors in her closing arguments that Blake killed Bakley because she had tricked him into marrying her by getting pregnant.
