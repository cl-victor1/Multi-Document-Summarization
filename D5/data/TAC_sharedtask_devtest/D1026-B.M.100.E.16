Nationally in 2003, 52 percent of fatally injured motorcycle riders were not wearing helmets.
The peak year for Arizona motorcycle fatalities was 1979 with 134 fatalities, three years after the state's short-lived helmet law was repealed.
The bikers want lawmakers to repeal the lingering provisions of the 1997 law that allows motorcyclists to ride without a helmet if they have a 10,000 insurance policy or have taken a rider safety training course.
As a motorcyclist who chooses to wear a helmet, there is no question in my mind that helmets are an extremely important piece of safety gear.
