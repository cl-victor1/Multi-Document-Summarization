The Food and Drug Administration silenced one of its drug experts who raised safety concerns weeks before Merck &amp; Co. yanked the blockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack and strokes.
The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
The FDA said last week after Vioxx was withdrawn that the problems were unique to that drug.
