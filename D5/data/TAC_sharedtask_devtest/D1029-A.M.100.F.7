Thousands of government workers and their families have evacuated a remote town in southwestern Pakistan amid fears of renewed fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces after clashes left at least 30 people dead.
Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told reporters in the capital, Islamabad.
the troops opened fire only when they came under attack.
the attack, which he blamed on the area dominant Bugti tribe, was totally unprovoked and blatant aggression.
