Jurors in the murder case against actor Robert Blake deliberated for more than five hours Monday without reaching a verdict _ and without making any requests to review trial testimony or evidence.
Blake, 71, shook from apparent emotion when the verdict was read by the clerk for Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp.
Schwartzbach also attacked the credibility of the prosecution's two key witnesses, both of whom have admitted being heavy drug users.
Blake, 71, is accused of killing his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, who was shot in his car near Vitello's, his favorite restaurant.
