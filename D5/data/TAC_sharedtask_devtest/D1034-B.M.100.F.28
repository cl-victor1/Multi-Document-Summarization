It appears that DEET does not readily biodegrade when it leaves wastewater treatment plants, Martinet said, which raises the question of whether it might accumulate in groundwater or sediments and increase over time to more troublesome levels.
A recent study looking more closely at DEET, in which Kolpin was one of the authors, suggested additional studies on DEET's potential toxicity to aquatic life because it is so widespread in streams receiving treated wastewater.
A leading suspect is the chytrid fungus, which in recent decades has killed amphibians from deserts to lowland tropical forests to mountainsides.
