"The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.
While the National Wildlife Federation is backing the delisting of the grizzly bear, other environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resource Defense Council are opposed and threaten to sue the federal government to block the move.
Stripping the bears of protection could eventually clear the way for hunting of grizzlies in that region.
Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600 pounds.
