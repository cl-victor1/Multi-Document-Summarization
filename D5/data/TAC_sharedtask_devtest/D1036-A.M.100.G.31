Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych is urging Ukraine's parliament to set up a special commission to see whether the United States financed opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko's presidential campaign, his spokesman said Sunday.
Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, a day after having late-night food and drinks with Ihor Smeshko, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, and others.
Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin.
