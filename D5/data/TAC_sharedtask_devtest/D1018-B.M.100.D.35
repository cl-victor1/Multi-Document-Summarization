Van der Sloot and his friends Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, are believed to be among the last people to see Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
Joran's mother, Anita van der Sloot, 49, told the AP last week that he, too, had changed his story, acknowledging now that he and Natalee were alone together at a beach near the Marriott, but she said he insists he left her there and did not hurt her.
Van der Straaten declined to provide further details, saying only that it was "part of the investigation".
Police have taken van der Sloot
