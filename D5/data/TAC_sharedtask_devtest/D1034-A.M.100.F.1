After six-and-a-half years of mending broken legs and treating disease, Australia's only frog hospital is closing its doors due to a lack of funding.
Cairns Frog Hospital in northern Queensland state, which at times had as many as 200 sick amphibians in its care, has had to close down because of unsustainable costs, founder Deborah Pergolotti told AFP on Friday.
"We're not taking in any more cases," she said, adding that the hospital had been hit by an increase in sick frogs being brought in and a reluctance by Australians to pay for the medical treatment.
