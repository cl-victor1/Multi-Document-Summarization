U.S. government officials were trying to trace a cow shipped to the United States from the same Canadian herd as an animal infected with mad cow disease, yet officials said it was unlikely the imported cow had been infected.
The Washington state animal had been imported from Canada, which has had three other cases of mad cow disease.
The susected case, in a beef cow, had tested negative for mad cow disease.
The money will pay for collaboration with laboratories in Britain, Italy and Spain.
It further demonstrates that USDA is dangerously premature in issuing this final rule.
