Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing four.
In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
So far, no cases of illness have been linked to the recalled products, the USDA said.
In 1993, the agency asked the administration for the power to bar fruits, vegetables, grains, fish and other food from countries with food-safety systems inferior to that of the United States.
