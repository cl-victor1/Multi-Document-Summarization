Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to the intractable disease.
The government said Switzerland should not lose its edge in pharmacology and biotechnology by banning stem cell research, which provides hopes for the treatment of various diseases, such as paralysis, heart attack, diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's.
The embryonic stem cells were then transplanted into six cynomolgus monkeys, which had druginduced symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease in humans.
Scientists believe they have pinpointed a tiny genetic flaw that is to blame
