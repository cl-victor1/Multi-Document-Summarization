Jury selection for the trial of suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski is under way in Sacramento, California, with an unprecedented number of nearly 600 prospective jurors to be interviewed.
Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year.
Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento.
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. issued that order today in denying a news media motion to make juror names public.
