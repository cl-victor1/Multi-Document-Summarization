Hong Kong's Department of Health (DH) announced Wednesday three more new Influenza A H5N1 cases, which brings the total number of cases to nine confirmed and six suspected.
Of the five other cases suspected of being infected of the H5N1 virus, four are under treatment in satisfactory condition and one, a 19-year-old girl, is in critical condition.
Hong Kong's neighbor city of Shenzhen has not discovered any case of H5N1 virus infection at its 200 poultry farms.
The sales of chicken have dropped about 30 percent since bird flu killed children in Hong Kong this month.
