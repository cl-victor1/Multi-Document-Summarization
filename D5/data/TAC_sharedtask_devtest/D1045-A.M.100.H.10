The front of the polluted water of Songhua River in northeast China reached Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province, on early Thursday morning, local environment authority said.
Zhang Lijun, deputy director general of SEPA said China would keep Russia informed at all times about the monitoring results of the polluted stretches of Songhua River.
After the explosion at the Jilin Petrochemical Company under China National Petroleum Corporation, our observation showed pollutants containing benzene had flown into the Songhua River and caused water pollution.
It has compelled cities along the river to suspend water taking from the river for various periods.
