The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
Citing witness testimony that Blake didn't appear to be sincere when he cried the night his wife was shot to death.
Robert Blake's lawyer told jurors that they should discredit the testimony of two aging Hollywood stuntmen who say Blake asked them to kill his wife because they are drug addicts who have lied to authorities.
Prosecutors argued that Blake's account didn't add up because nobody saw him retrieve the gun from the restaurant.
