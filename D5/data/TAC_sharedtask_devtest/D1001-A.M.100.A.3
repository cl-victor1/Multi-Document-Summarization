The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed Tuesday when two gunmen burst into the Jefferson County school wielding guns and bombs.
The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
A community formed around that high school, and the school grew as the community grew, said Gerry Difford, who opened Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years.
