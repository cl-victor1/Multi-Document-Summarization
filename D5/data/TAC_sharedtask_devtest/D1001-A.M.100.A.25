Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
The sheriff's initial estimate of as many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building counted some victims more than once.
The New York Times plans two pages of stories, photos and graphics on the aftermath of the school shooting in a Denver suburb that left 15 dead.
