The death toll of Papua New Guinea s tidal wave disaster may be more than 3,000, Australian media reported Monday.
'' The 23-foot wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7 undersea earthquake, destroyed at least three other villages Friday night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on the island of New Guinea, north of Australia, where some people live a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
The tsunami struck west of Aitape in West Sepik province, hitting villages about 370 miles northwest of Port Moresby.
Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said
