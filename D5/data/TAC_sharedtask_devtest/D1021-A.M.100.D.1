A hitch has developed in a plea deal agreed to by a former teacher who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.
The agreement was meant to resolve charges against Debra Lafave, 25, in two counties.
But the judge in one of the counties has balked, Ric Ridgeway, a spokesman for the State Attorney's Office, said Thursday.
Lafave was sentenced to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty last month in Hillsborough County to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
