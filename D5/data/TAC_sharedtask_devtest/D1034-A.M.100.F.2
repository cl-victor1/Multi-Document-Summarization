The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face extinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of mammal species.
Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
The first vertebrate species to begin hopping and crawling on land 350 million years ago may be the first to die out, according to a study released Thursday that found a third of all amphibian species worldwide are threatened with extinction.
