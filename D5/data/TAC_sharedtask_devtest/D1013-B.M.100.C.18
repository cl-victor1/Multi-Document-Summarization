Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge accounts or purchase merchandise.
An identity theft hotline established last year by the Federal Trade Commission reports getting 400 calls a week.
But in the same report, GAO acknowledged that it could find ``no comprehensive statistics on the prevalence of identity fraud.'' When Mason called the store, he was told that the person with the credit cards took a job at Filene's Basement using Mason's name and Social Security number.
