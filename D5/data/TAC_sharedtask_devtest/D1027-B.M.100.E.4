In Laramie, where Russell Henderson is on trial for the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard, social service agencies could lose more than $100,000 unless the county can come up with a way to pay for prosecuting and defending Henderson and co-defendant Aaron McKinney.
Henderson had been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the beating death of Shepard.
Two other men wait trial in the case.
Henderson and McKinney face the death penalty if convicted.
Now color, religion or national origin.
Also, the bill would make federal prosecution of hate crimes easier.
