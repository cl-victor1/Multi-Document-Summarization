Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) on Thursday denied its involvement in the dioxin poisoning of the opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko.
``I've always contended that poisonings are more common than people think,'' he says.
To Western readers, especially, the poisoning may seem like an outlandish plot twist ripped off from Renaissance history.
Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
