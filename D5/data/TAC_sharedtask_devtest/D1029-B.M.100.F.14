A parliamentary delegation headed Tuesday to a remote town in Pakistan's southwest Baluchistan province in a bid to end a siege by hundreds of armed tribesmen.
Three bombs in Pakistan's restive southwestern province of Baluchistan damaged a power line and a shop but caused no casualties, officials said Tuesday.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
The commander, Brig.
Salim Nawaz, said on Tuesday that thousands of Bugti tribesmen armed with rocketpropelled grenades and automatic weapons have surrounded a military base near Dera Bugti, in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan
