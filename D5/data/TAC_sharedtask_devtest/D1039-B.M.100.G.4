A suspected Islamic extremist of Dutch-Moroccan descent was arraigned Friday on charges of murder and terrorism, accused of killing a director whose film denounced the mistreatment of women in Muslim communities.
Van Gogh's killing had a ritualistic, execution-like quality reminiscent of this year's videotaped beheadings in Iraq, analysts said.
Is this a murder, or is this a terrorist attack?
There has never been a terrorist attack on Dutch soil.
Both Wilders and Hirsi Ali are under police protection.
The suspect has so far refused to speak to investigators.
Jihad has come to the Netherlands.
