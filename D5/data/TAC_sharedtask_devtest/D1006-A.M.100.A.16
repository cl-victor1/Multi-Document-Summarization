Pfizer Inc. warned doctors on Friday that one of its bestselling painkillers, Bextra, might increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke in coronary artery bypass surgery patients.
"Merck removed Vioxx from sale Sept. 28 after seeing an increased risk of "serious cardiovascular events," the FDA said, including heart attacks and strokes".
Momentum was growing for a fresh look at the safety of Celebrex and other pain relievers as key researchers, a congressman and European regulators said they feared such drugs might raise the risk of heart problems like those blamed on the arthritis medicine Vioxx.
