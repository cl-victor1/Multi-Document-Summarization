As the people of Indonesia's Aceh province try to rebuild lives shattered by the tsunami disaster, officials are assessing the environmental damage to the coast which bore the brunt of the giant waves.
Besides the untold human misery, officials say the quake and giant waves wrought havoc on the marine ecosystem, tearing up coral reefs and wiping out mangrove forests and seaweed beds along the coast.
Government experts and United Nations officials say it could take years and hundreds of million of dollars to restore the environmental damage to these backbones of the marine ecosystem caused by the natural disaster.
