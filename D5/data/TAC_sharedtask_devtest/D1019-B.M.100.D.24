A group of tourists who were kidnapped from a Malaysian resort island Sunday are being held in southern Philippines.
The hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and a Filipino.
The hostages, who were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf in a resort in Sipadan, Malaysia, Sunday night, are now in the Philippines' Sulu Province.
