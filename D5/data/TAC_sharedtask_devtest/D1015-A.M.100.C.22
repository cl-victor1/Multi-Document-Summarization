The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon rain forest.
Malaysia, also endowed with rich tropical rain forest, will build bases on its territory to pick up and analyse data from the satellites.
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
