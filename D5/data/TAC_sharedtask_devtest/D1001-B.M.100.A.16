The roughly 2,000 Columbine students haven't been in class since Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on a shooting and bombing rampage on April 20, killing 12 students, a teacher and themselves.
School officials said they called eight to 10 ``friends and acquaintances'' of gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and asked if they would prefer not to attend Chatfield.
Welcoming signs and banners decorated Chatfield High School today as students arrived from former rival Columbine.
The U.S. police authorities Monday arrested a man suspicious of supplying the semiautomatic pistol used in the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado State.
