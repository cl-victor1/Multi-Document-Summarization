The Food and Drug Administration told Merck &amp; Co. that it requires further safety and efficacy data before it will approve its successor drug to now defunct pain reliever Vioxx, the pharmaceutical maker announced Friday.
They found that patients given Vioxx had 2.3 times the risk of heart attacks as those given placebos or other pain medications.
"When I heard about this Vioxx scare, I just took myself right off it," she said.
Merck shares were trading above $45 a share before the Vioxx recall late last month.
Vioxx belonged to a class of drugs called Cox-2 inhibitors.
