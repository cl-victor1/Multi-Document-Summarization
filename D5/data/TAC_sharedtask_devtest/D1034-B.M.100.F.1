Greenpeace is seeking to raise awareness of the need to protect ancient forests in Indonesia's Papua, where a virtual "lost world" of new species was discovered last year, an activist said Tuesday.
Greenpeace's flagship Rainbow Warrior steamed into the Papuan capital Jayapura last week for a series of forums in Indonesia's easternmost province, Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaigner Hapsoro told AFP.
The environmental watchdog has also been setting up forestry initiatives aimed at protecting dwindling forests.
In Manokwari, Papua's second city, Greenpeace held a forum for forestry students Tuesday, Hapsoro said by telephone.
