Pakistan has moved thousands of troops into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on a gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.
Armed police commandos were deployed on trains traveling in Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province on Wednesday, a day after bombings damaged a portion of a rail track and wounded three policemen, an official said.
Officials blame tribesmen for the attacks.
Last Thursday a barrage of rockets fired at Dera Bugti killed up to 30 people including 18 Hindus and eight paramilitary soldiers.
The conflict was linked to a tribal leader's demands for more revenues from natural gas
