People eating animal meat products contaminated with mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can develop a human variant of the fatal brain-wasting disease, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Brain tissue samples from a suspected US beef cow began its trip to England on Thursday for final tests to confirm if it is the second case of mad cow disease in the United States.
A new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was discovered in Spain, thus raising the number of cases in the country to 20 since the first appearance of the disease in 2000.
