A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens.
The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people on board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that rapidly starved the pilots of oxygen.
High in the skies above the Aegean Sea, two Greek fighter pilots nudged their F-16s to either side of a Cypriot passenger jet and quickly discerned the disaster that was unfolding.
The Helios Airways flight ZU522 was headed from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens International Airport.
