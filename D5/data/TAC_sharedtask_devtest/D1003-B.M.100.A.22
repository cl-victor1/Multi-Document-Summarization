The regional telcom network covers the administrative office building of Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, a giant panda museum, and China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Pandas, the open-air habitat for the endangered species.
The two giant pandas at the city's zoo retired to their favorite spot under a few bushes and mated over the past two days the only successful natural insemination of a panda this year in the United States.
The newborn was doing fine and was secluded with its mother in the zoo's giant panda quarters, monitored around the clock by veterinary staff via cameras.
