A crew member or passenger may have made a last, desperate attempt to save a Cypriot passenger jet before it crashed into a mountainside north of Athens, killing all 121 people aboard, Greek media reported Wednesday.
The airliner's pilots had reported air conditioning system problems to Cyprus air traffic control about a half-hour after takeoff.
