Authorities urged nearly 2 million people to evacuate coastal areas stretching from Florida to North Carolina today as Hurricane Floyd, one of the most powerful and biggest storms to ever threaten the United States, roared through the Bahamas.
Hurricane Floyd pounded the Bahamas with howling winds and blinding rain today, snapping palm trees in half, downing power lines and churning up dangerous surf throughout the vulnerable islands east of Florida.
Hurricane Floyd grew into a Category 5 storm with 250 kph winds and headed toward the Bahamas Monday, threatening the Florida coast of the United States, U.S. forecasters said.
