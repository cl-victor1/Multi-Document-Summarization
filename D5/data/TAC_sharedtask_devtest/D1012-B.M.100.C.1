One month after Greece's worst air accident, a conclusive explanation of what caused a Cypriot Helios Airways airliner to crash killing all 121 people on board still eludes investigators, but recent reports suggest pilots may have failed to respond to a cabin pressure warning.
A preliminary report last month said Helios Flight 522 lost cabin pressure and ran out of fuel before crashing into a hillside near Grammatiko, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Athens, on the sunny and clear morning of Aug. 14.
