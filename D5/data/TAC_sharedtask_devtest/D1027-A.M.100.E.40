Opening arguments in Russell Henderson's trial have been scheduled for April 6.
During his comments to potential jurors, defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs shifted the blame for the killing to Henderson's co-defendant, McKinney, who was to be tried later.
Skaggs asked prospective jurors not to punish his client for the sake of redeeming this small town's image in the eyes of the nation.
The pair pretended to be homosexual and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a downtown bar before they beat him and then left him lashed to a fence in a remote area east of town.
