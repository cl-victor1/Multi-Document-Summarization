Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
The Ramseys remain under suspicion in the homicide.
The city already has spent more than $1 million in its investigation.
Yet others critical of how the investigation has been handled do not support Ramsey.
By talking to prosecutors now, the Ramseys may be trying to head off grand jury appearances later this summer.
