A work group of the State Council, China's cabinet, will leave here on Friday afternoon for Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, to investigate the major water pollution in Songhua River, which has led to a four-day water supply suspension in the city.
The Chinese government has also informed Russia of the pollution, which could affect its neighbor when the pollution slick flows into the Heilongjiang River bordering China and Russia.
Benzene and nitrobenzene flew into the river following a blast at China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) Jilin Petrochemical company, a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province.
