Scientists said the likely cause was "hot material" in the mountain coming into contact with glacier water, causing a boiling beneath and a burst of steam.
Lowenstern spoke Tuesday of lesser consequences: a narrow column of rising magma, that seems to be moving toward the volcano's dome and is creating steam when it encounters water, snow and ice.
The restive volcano then let off more steam and ash Tuesday as hot rock pushing toward the surface melted the peak's glaciers, promoting scientists to predict that an eruption could hit at any time.
The steam has melted a pond about 100
