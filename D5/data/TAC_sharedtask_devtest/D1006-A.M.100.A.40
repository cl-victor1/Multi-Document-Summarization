Less than a week after Merck Co. yanked its popular Vioxx arthritis drug off the market, the New England Journal of Medicine voiced strong concerns about the safety of Pfizer's bestselling Celebrex.
They feared such drugs might raise the risk of heart problems like those blamed on the arthritis medicine Vioxx.
David Graham, associate director for science in the drug safety division of the Food and Drug Administration, by early August had notified his supervisors that a study of Vioxx showed patients on the starting dose had 50 percent greater risk of cardiac arrest than those on competitor Celebrex.
