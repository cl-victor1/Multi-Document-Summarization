By talking to prosecutors now, the Ramseys may be trying to headoff grand jury appearances later this summer.
After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hearfrom neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well asmany members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl'sparents, John and Patsy Ramsey.
Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after aformer Boulder police detective on the case and three formerfriends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor,Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
