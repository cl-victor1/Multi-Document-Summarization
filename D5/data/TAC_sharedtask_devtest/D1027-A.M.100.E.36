The trial for one of two men accused in the beating death of University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard has been postponed.
Russell Henderson, 21, is accused of posing as a homosexual to lure the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6.
Henderson, along with Aaron McKinney, allegedly kidnapped and pistol-whipped Shepard and left him tied to a fence in the cold.
Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if convicted.
As he said this, Matthew Shepard's mother, Judy, who was in the last row of the courtroom, slowly looked down.
