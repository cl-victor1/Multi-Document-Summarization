The New York Times: -- Theodore J. Kaczynski pleaded guilty Thursday to all the Federal charges against him, acknowledging that he was the Unabomber who killed and maimed people with package bombs in a solitary 18-year campaign aimed at bringing down the technological system.
Washington welcomed Khatami's proposal, but insisted that the best way to address the issues between the two countries is through dialogue between the two governments.
Last January, Kaczynski pleaded guilty to killing three men and injuring two others in a bombing campaign that terrorized the nation between 1978 and 1995.
