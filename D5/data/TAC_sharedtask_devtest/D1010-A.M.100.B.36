No cases of mad cow disease have been registered in Bulgaria, where beef meat began to be closely examined for the disease in 2001.
The human form of mad cow disease is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1 million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year.
As of October 27, more than 8,600 animals were tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the scientific name for mad cow, the agency said in a news release.
