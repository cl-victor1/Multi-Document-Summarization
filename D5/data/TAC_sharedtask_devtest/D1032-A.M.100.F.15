Statoil did not say when it expected to resume production at its Snorre A platform, noting that a permanent cap had not been put in place.
The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of 130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day.
Statoil also said it submitted a report on its progress in sealing the well to the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Tuesday, and that resuming crude oil flows also depends on the authority giving the go-ahead.
