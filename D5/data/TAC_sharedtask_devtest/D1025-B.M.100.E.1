A group of 269 biologists and other scientists from around the country asked the Fish and Wildlife Service on Monday not to lift the protections given to the Yellowstone grizzly bear by the Endangered Species Act.
Doing that, they said, could jeopardize its survival.
A letter from the scientists came on the last day of the comment period on the agency's plan to remove protection for the bear.
The service has said that the bear population, estimated at 500 to 600, is fully recovered and growing at 4 percent a year.
