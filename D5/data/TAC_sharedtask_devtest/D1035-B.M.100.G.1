DALLAS (AP) -- Secret U.S. tests of Agent Orange in Panama during the Vietnam War may have exposed many residents and military personnel to potentially lethal chemicals, The Dallas Morning News reported today.
Hundreds of barrels of the toxic herbicide were shipped to Panama during the 1960s and 1970s, then sprayed on jungles in an effort to simulate the battlefield conditions of Southeast Asia, the newspaper reported, citing documents and witness accounts.
Both Panamanians and Americans may have been exposed.
The U.S. Southern Command, the operational authority in Panama, said it was unaware of any tests involving Agent Orange there.
