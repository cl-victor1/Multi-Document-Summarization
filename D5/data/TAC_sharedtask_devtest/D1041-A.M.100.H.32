"The coral reef system might be totally destroyed.
Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs "have been effectivelydestroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery." Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at thosethree sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf,which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in theRed Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and wherealgae strains are less heat-tolerant.
In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths ofmany coral reefs, a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years.
