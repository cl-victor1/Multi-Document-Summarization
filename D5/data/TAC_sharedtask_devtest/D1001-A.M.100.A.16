Students returned to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls.
The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre.
``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for the spirit of America,'' Gore said.
Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
