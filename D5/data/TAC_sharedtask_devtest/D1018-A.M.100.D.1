Police questioned the father of a Dutch teenager detained in connection with the case of a missing American teenager, hoping he may have seen something to help resolve the mystery, officials said Sunday.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
"He was questioned as a witness, no more or no less," van der Straaten told The Associated Press, declining to give details.
The attorney general's spokeswoman, Mariaine Croes, said witnesses are questioned when prosecutors believe they may be able to add something to the case.
