Lebanese Prime Minister Omar Karami announced resignation of his government on Monday amid massive demonstrations over the assassination of his predecessor Rafik al- Hariri.
The Swiss Foreign Ministry announced Thursday that it has agreed to a United Nations request to help investigate the Feb. 14 Beirut bombing which killed former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri.
A no-confidence vote was expected at the end of the debate, but the special parliamentary session culminated with the resignation of Karami's government.
Hariri, who was opposed to Syria's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, was assassinated in a bomb blast in Beirut on Feb. 14.
