Less than a week after Merck Co. yanked its popular Vioxx arthritis drug off the market, the New England Journal of Medicine voiced strong concerns about the safety of Pfizer's bestselling Celebrex.
The announcement comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
There was discussion of keeping the drug for short-term use, but the company did not think it was practical.
