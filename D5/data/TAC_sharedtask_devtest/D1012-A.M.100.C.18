Before the plane crashed, the Greek fighter pilots reported seeing two people trying to take the controls in the cockpit.
A timeline of events leading up to the crash Sunday of a Cypriot airliner in Greece, in which 121 people were killed, as released by the Greek government.
After losing contact with the Athens airport's control tower, the Greek air force immediately sent two F-16 fighter jets to lead the airliner.
Airport officials in Larnaka said the pilot of the airliner reported problems with the air-conditioning system minutes before losing contact with Greek and Cypriot traffic controllers.
