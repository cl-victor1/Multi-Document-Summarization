Massive searches by FBI agents, Dutch Marines, Aruban police and thousands of islanders have produced no trace of Holloway, a recent high school graduate from Mountain Brook, Alabama.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge in training in Aruba, gave his 17-year-old son Joran van der Sloot and two Surinamese brothers legal advice the day after 18-year-old Natalee Holloway disappeared, District Attorney Caren Janssen told MSNBC in an interview.
The latest search group, the Texas-based Texas EquuSearch, also has failed to find Holloway after using specially trained dogs and ocean-searching sonar equipment.
