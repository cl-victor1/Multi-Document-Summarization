Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student.
The victim's mother said this didn't happen," said school district spokesman Stephen Hegarty "Everybody who would know about this said it wasn't happening." Fitzgibbons said in July that plea negotiations had broken off because prosecutors insisted on prison time, which he said would be too dangerous for someone as attractive as Lafave He said then that she planned to plead insanity at trial, claiming emotional stress kept her from knowing right from wrong.
