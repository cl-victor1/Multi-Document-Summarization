The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on beaches.
Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol village had almost been completely destroyed.
