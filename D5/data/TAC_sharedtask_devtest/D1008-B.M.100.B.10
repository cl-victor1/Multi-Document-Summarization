The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
Some say the oyster industry in the Chesapeake is more endangered than the animal itself.
About 11 percent of the bay's nitrogen comes from power plants.
A $19.4 million plan to reduce pollution and restore bay grasses and oyster habitat to the Corsica River was announced by Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. Tuesday as a ``blueprint'' for saving the Chesapeake Bay.
