Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge accounts or purchase merchandise.
The Social Security Administration received more than 30,000 complaints about the misuse of Social Security numbers last year; most of the complaints concerned identity theft.
Under the new law, a conviction for identity theft carries a maximum 15 years jail sentence, a fine and forfeiture of any personal property used to commit the crime.
``I've never been a victim of identity theft,'' she says.
