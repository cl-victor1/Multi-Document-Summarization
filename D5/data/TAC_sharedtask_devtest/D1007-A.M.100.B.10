The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
It said the risk of infection is low because the H5N1 virus was only found in imported chicken so far.
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
