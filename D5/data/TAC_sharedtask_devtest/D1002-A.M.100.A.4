The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.
The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at the future criminal trial of the four officers.
The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand jury.
The defendants remain on restricted duty pending the outcome of the trial, which is scheduled for January.
