said a young woman who worked at the factory.
The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S. Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, and Dar es-Salaam two weeks ago.
Addressing the same press conference, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf condemned Thursday's attack on the north Khartoum factory, in which hospital officials say 10 people were injured.
She added: ``This violence will only beget more violence.'' The Security Council was expected to take up the matter on Monday, council sources said Friday.
