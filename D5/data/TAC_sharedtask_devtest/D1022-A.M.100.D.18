Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).
"We're working internationally, we're working bilaterally, we're very, very keen to see firstly, no reopening of commercial whaling, and very importantly, no scientific whaling in the future," he said.
Japan announced in April it plans to seek permission to extend its research whaling program in the Antarctic when the IWC meets later this month.
The Tasman Sea separates Australia and New Zealand, two nations strongly opposed to Japan's continuing hunting of whales under a research program.
