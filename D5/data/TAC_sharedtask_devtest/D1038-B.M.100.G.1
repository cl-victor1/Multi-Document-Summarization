US authorities on Wednesday lowered the eruption alert around the Mount St. Helens volcano, saying that an explosion of the simmering peak was no longer imminent.
The alert level was dropped from three to two nearly two weeks after the volcano in the northwestern state of Washington -- which killed 57 people in 1980 -- began shaking the earth and belching steam and ash, scientists said.
