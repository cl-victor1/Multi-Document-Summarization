Indonesia is considering plans to restrict construction along some coastlines in tsunami-hit Aceh province, while planting mangrove forests to act as a natural barrier against high surf, newspapers said Saturday.
The draft plan, released Friday during a government Cabinet meeting in Aceh, calls for tsunami-stricken areas to be divided into three redevelopment zones.
Thick mangrove forests, which once covered wide swathes of Sumatra Island, would be planted in the hardest-hit towns, including Meulaboh, Calang and the provincial capital Banda Aceh, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, minister for national development planning, was quoted as saying in The Jakarta Post.
