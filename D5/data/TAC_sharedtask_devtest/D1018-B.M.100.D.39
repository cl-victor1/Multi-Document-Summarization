Holloway, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours of May 30, the last day of a vacation with 124 students celebrating their high school graduation.
Meanwhile, Holloway mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, told The Associated Press.
These three guys cannot commit a perfect crime.
Madison Whatley, one of Holloway three roommates during the trip, has been a regular at prayer vigils at a local church.
No formal charges have been filed against any of the suspects.
