Holloway Twitty was distributing prayer cards for her daughter around the island Tuesday when she found herself in Noord, a town in northwestern Aruba where van der Sloots' parents, justice official Paul van der Sloot and his wife, Anita van der Sloot, live.
Paul van der Sloot, a judge in training in Aruba, gave his 17-year-old son Joran van der Sloot and two Surinamese brothers legal advice the day after 18-year-old Natalee Holloway disappeared, District Attorney Caren Janssen told MSNBC in an interview.
