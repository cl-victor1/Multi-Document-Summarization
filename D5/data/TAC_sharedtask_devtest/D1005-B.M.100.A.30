South Korea will allow stem-cell research to find cures for 18 diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's and cerebral palsy, government officials said Thursday.
Japanese researchers said Tuesday they had successfully treated monkeys with Parkinson's disease through a stem cell transplant, potentially paving the way for an ideal remedy to the intractable disease.
A small group of people with Parkinson's disease had been pleading for months with the biotechnology company Amgen : Let them resume taking an experimental drug that the patients said had helped them but which the company said was ineffective and possibly dangerous.
