Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the 23-foot (7-meter) wave hurled him into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano lagoon.
The villages of Nimas and Warapu also had been swept from a low-lying sand spit into Sissano lagoon.
Thousands of people have also been made homeless since Tsunamis, or tidal wave, obliterated villages following a 7.0 degree earthquake on Richter scale in the Bismarck Sea off Papua New Guinea's northwest coast.
