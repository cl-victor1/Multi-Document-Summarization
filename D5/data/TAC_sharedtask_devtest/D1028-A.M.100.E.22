Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
A federal judge has rejected a motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of those bombings, which killed two men and wounded others.
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
The suspect, Theodore Kaczynski, a 55-year-old former University of California math instructor, is charged with four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber, two of which are fatal.
