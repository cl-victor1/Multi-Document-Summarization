A hurricane liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.
Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also threatened the Florida coast.
By comparison, Floyd's hurricane-force wind extended 105 miles north and east of its center, said Todd Kimberlain, a forecaster at the hurricane center.
Floyd was expected to intensify, and it was unlikely to hit land soon.
