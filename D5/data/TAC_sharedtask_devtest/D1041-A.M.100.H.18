More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
"The coral reef system might be totally destroyed.
It will take hundreds of years to grow back," he said.
The oil spill has blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area, causing an ecological disaster that will take the sensitive ecosystem years from which to recover.
