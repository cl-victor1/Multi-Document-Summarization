Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
Sudan I is banned from food in Britain and across the European Union, and since 2003 all chili powder imported to Britain must be certified to be free of Sudan I. The sauce was then added as an ingredient to at least 359 products made by supermarkets and leading food companies such as Unilever.
Sudan I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oil, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
