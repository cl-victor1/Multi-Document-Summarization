U.S. oyster farmer ponders future as endangered species tag looms OYSTER BAY, New York A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
