Bangladesh has already sent medicines and other relief goods for the tsunami victims in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Uzbekistan on Monday sent a plane with 35 metric tons of humanitarian aid to tsunami-hit Indonesia, the Foreign Ministry said.
An extremely powerful earthquake and the tsunami that followed devastated many parts of North Sumatra and Aceh on Dec. 26 last year, killing more than 100,000 people there.
The ambassador said that his government would conduct a survey this week in Aceh province in order to find out what is the most needed for survivors in the tsunami-hit areas.
