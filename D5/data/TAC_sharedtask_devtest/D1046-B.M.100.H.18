Sweden is prepared to freeze the 7.6 million-US dollar debt over the next two years owed by Indonesia, which was hard hit by last month's tsunami disaster, the Swedish finance minister announced on Wednesday.
Indonesia was the worst affected by the December 26 earthquake and tsunami disaster, with up to 115,000 people killed.
The earthquake and tsunami that shattered Indonesia's Aceh province caused damage and losses worth US$4.5 billion (euro3.45 billion), the government said Wednesday.
It is estimated that more than 1.8 million people in the tsunami-hit regions need food aid and 5 million have been made homeless.
