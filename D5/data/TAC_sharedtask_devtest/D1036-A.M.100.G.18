Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in Vienna who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed Saturday.
Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
But cases of dioxin poisoning are extremely rare.
The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
