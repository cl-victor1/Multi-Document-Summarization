A Cypriot Helios Airways Boeing 737 jetliner with 115 passengers and six crew members on board crashed Sunday north of Athens, Greek news media reported.
It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
Suspicions of a technical fault as the cause of the crash grew through the day as several of the callers said that they had experienced severe air conditioning problems when flying similar Helios jets in recent months.Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for the last hour
