Seven people close to Islamic groups in The Netherlands are to be charged with terrorist-related activities over the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh, the Amsterdam public prosecutor said on Friday.
Prosecutor's working on Van Gogh's murder are investigating whether the men arrested were part of a larger network.
The Dutch government has declared war on Islamic extremism following the brutal killing of filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh by a suspected radical Muslim.
Police said the suspect, a 26-year old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality who was arrested shortly after the murder, had links to Islamic extremists.
