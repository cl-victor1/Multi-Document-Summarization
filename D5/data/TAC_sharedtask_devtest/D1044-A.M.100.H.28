The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
Sudan I is banned from food in Britain and across the European Union, and since 2003 all chili powder imported to Britain must be certified to be free of Sudan I. It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain and the rest of the European Union and all chilli powder imported since July 2003 has to be certified free of the agent.
