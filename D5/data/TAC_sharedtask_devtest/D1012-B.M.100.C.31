The airliner's pilots had reported air conditioning system problems to Cyprus air traffic control about a half-hour after takeoff.
Associated Press writers Derek Gatopoulos in Grammatiko, Greece, Paris Agiomamitis in Athens and Alex Efty in Nicosia, Cyprus, contributed to this report.
Autopsy results on 26 bodies identified have shown passengers and at least two crew members _ including the co-pilot _ were alive, but not necessarily conscious, when the plane went down.
The plane's flight data recorder and the remains of the badly damaged voice recorder will be examined in Paris.
