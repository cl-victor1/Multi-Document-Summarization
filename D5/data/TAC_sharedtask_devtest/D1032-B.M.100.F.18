State-controlled company Statoil shut down its Snorre A platform and satellite platform Vigdis on November 28 last year after a gas leak was detected.
The safety authority has called the gas leak from a production well one of the most serious incidents ever on the Norwegian continental shelf.
Full production from the Snorre A and nearby Vigdis fields would restore about 205,000 barrels a day of production, or some 6.4 percent of this Nordic country's 3.2 million barrel per day capacity.
No one was injured, but the leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew from Snorre A platform.
