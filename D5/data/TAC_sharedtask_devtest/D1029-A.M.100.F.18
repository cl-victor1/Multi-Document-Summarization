On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.
