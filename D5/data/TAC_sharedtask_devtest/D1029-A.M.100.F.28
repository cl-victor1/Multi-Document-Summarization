Fierce gun battles between tribal rebels and Pakistani troops in the troubled southwestern province of Baluchistan have left up to 30 people dead and more than 70 injured, an official said Friday.
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui.
