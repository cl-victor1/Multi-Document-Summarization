On Friday, IBP recalled 266,000 pounds of ground meat produced May 13 at a plant in Geneseo, Ill., also for possible E. coli 0157:H7 contamination.
The USDA said last month that it was planning new safety standards for the ground beef it buys for schools.
There were maybe 1,000 units involved and it hurts.
Shipping cases were marked L0231BH, L0311BH, L0791BH.
The recall covered products produced between July and December 1998.
No ailments have been reported from any of the recalled meat.
It's also the only genetically engineered crop of any kind not approved for food use.
