The last such case was in July 1997, when Officer Paolo Colecchia was convicted of second-degree manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed man in the back as he fled down a Bronx subway platform.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree murder.
A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant.
Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer for Sean Carroll, said he might make a motion to disqualify Stephen C. Worth, the lawyer for Edward McMellon.
