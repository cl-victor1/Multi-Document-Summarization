Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National Intelligence Service successively between December 1999 and April 2003, are suspected of overseeing the agency's monitoring of mobile phone conversations of about 1,800 of South Korea's political, corporate and media elite, the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office said.
The scandal, dubbed the "X-files" by South Korean media, surfaced in July after revelations of a 1997 wiretapped phone conversation between Hong and Lee Hak-soo, who purportedly discussed providing illicit campaign funds to candidates in the presidential race, won by former dissident Kim Dae-jung.
