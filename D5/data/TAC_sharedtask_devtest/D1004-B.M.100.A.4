The death toll of Papua New Guinea (PNG)'s tidal wave disaster may be more than 3,000, Australian media reported Monday.
Chittleborough said the NTF would also use data from the tsunamis which wiped out villages on the remote northwest coast of Papua New Guinea Friday night, killing more than 1,000 people.
The tsunami struck west of Aitape in West Sepik province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers) northwest of Port Moresby.
The village of Arop was built on a sand spit and had a population of about 2,000 people.
