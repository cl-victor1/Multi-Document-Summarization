Listeria was a real problem for the United States in the mid-1980s, said Dr. Lester Crawford, director of Georgetown University's Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, but the government declared zero tolerance for the pathogen.
Both he and Dale Morris, the director of the division of infectious disease of the New York State Health Department, say there can never be enough notification.
The culprit, investigators say, is a strain of air and soil-borne bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes, which is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come into contact with raw vegetables, dairy products or uncooked meat.
