LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) -- The strategy for the first defendant on trial in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard is clear: blame the co-defendant.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs said.
``The defense will contend that Russell did not participate in the beating and did not share in the proceeds of the robbery,'' he said.
