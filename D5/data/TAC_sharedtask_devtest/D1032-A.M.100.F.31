Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia, with an average daily production of three million barrels.
Norwegian oil group Statoil said Monday that production on two of its platforms in the North Sea shut down last week because of a gas leak would probably remain suspended until at least next week.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
