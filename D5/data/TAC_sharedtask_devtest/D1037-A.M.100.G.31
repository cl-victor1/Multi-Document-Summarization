The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
For weeks this fall, even as St. Mary's County celebrated the beginning of oyster season with festivals and contests, Tucker and Agnes Brown couldn't find oysters.
Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), the Chesapeake executive council's outgoing chairman, said the lobbying effort would begin soon.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale.
