Like many degenerative brain diseases, including Parkinson's andAlzheimer's, proteins targeted in the disease process begin misfoldingand clumping in or around brain cells, which are called neurons.
While proteins that cause Alzheimer's and Parkinson's aredifferent, the pathology -- these deposits in or around brain cells --is similar.
He decided to build a microscope that would allow scientists tofollow brain cells over a long period, akin to videotaping a neuron'slife.
(That breakthrough is not likely to comesoon, scientists say, since Alzheimer's involves the loss of manykinds of brain cells.) Indoing their research, scientists take a few stem cells from very youngembryos and
