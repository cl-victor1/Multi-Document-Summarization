Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday.
Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
All four space shuttles were in hangars, but four multimillion-dollar rockets were on launch pads and couldn't be moved.
Tropical storm Floyd strengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane this year, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will take it north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern United States.
