Air sampling had detected only tiny amounts of the volcanic gases that new magma produces.
The greatest danger was expected to be potentially large ash plumes, which could shoot tens of thousands of feet up.
Which historically have been damaging consequences of volcanic eruptions in the Cascade Range.
The flash snow melt on the mountain triggered floods and mudslides, sending streams and rivers over their banks and destroying infrastructure for hundreds of miles around.
And if the mountain glacier melted as a result of an eruption, it could create a "debris flow" cascading down the mountain.
