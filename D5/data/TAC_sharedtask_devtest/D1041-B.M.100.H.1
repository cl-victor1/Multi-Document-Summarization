A team of researchers is meeting this week in New Caledonia to mark the launch a French initiative aimed at protecting the coral reefs of island states in the South Pacific.
The three-year project aims to support already-designated protected marine sites and to create new protected areas while better managing marine ecosystems to ensure the sustainable development of coral biodiversity.
Overfishing, poor management of coastal areas and sedimentation due to creeping urbanisation are often cited as the main threats to reef ecosystems, although those in the Pacific are less at threat than those in other regions.
