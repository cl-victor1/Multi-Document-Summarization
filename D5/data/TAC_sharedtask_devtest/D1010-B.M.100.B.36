A new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was discovered in Spain, thus raising the number of cases in the country to 20 since the first appearance of the disease in 2000.
A gene may protect some people from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human brain wasting form of mad cow disease, researchers said Thursday.
In May 2003, when the first Canadian cow tested positive for mad cow disease, officials traced a small number of animals from the same herd to the United States.
Canada last May confirmed a case of mad cow disease in Alberta.
