In a statement issued here, the AL General Secretariat expressed "shock and resentment" at the U.S. attack Thursday night on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's capital Khartoum, which injured several civilians.
Sudan decided Friday to recall its diplomats in Washington to protest the U.S. air raid on a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Thursday.
While Khartoum residents expressed surprise at the Thursday missile strike, many said they thought there was little their government could do.
Washington said the factory produced the ingredients of chemical weapons, but Khartoum said it manufactured only pharmaceutical products.
