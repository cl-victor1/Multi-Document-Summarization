The third study was conducted among British patients with Parkinson's who did not have a family history of the disease.
Parkinson's disease occurs when a group of brain cells which produce a chemical called dopamine begin to malfunction and eventually die.
Symptoms occur once 80 % of the cells have died.
The embryonic stem cells were then transplanted into six cynomolgus monkeys, which had drug-induced symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease in humans.
Despite its medical ramifications, critics say the research is unethical because culling stem cells destroys the embryo and could lead to human cloning.
