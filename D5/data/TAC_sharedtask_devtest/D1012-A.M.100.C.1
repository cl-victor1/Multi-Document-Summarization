Blackened bodies, tattered luggage and smoldering debris lay scattered among the pine trees in a scenic Greek valley after a Helios Airways flight slammed into a mountainside and filled the air with acrid smoke.
Constantinos Michas, a resident of Grammatiko near the ancient city of Marathon, was one of the first people on the scene Sunday.
"I took my car and went straight to the mountain...
I saw about 80 dead bodies, some were children," he said.
"There were some body parts but most were just as their mother made them" .
