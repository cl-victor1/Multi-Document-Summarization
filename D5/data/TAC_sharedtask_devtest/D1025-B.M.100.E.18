The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov. 21:The recovery of the grizzly bear population in the greater Yellowstone region is a triumph of human restraint.
Under the delisting plans, state officials in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho will take over management of the bears and may allow hunting outside the protected areas.
Wild creatures who live there include carnivores such as grizzly and black bears, a mutant white bear that native groups call the spirit bear, wolves and cougars.
Continual displacement of the bears is likely, and resumption of hunting seems a strong possibility.
