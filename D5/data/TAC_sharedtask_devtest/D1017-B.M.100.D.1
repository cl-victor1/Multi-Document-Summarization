NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd vented its fury on the Bahamas on Tuesday -- toppling trees and power lines, stripping roofs off homes and shoving a roiling sea into streets.
As Floyd bore down on the U.S. coast, 2 million people were urged to leave their homes in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
President Clinton issued pre-emptive disaster declarations for Florida and Georgia.
In the Bahamas, Floyd flung trees and debris into buildings in the Bahamas and chased frightened tourists from exposed hotel rooms to more enclosed space.
