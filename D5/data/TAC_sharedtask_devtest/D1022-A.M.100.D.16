The Australian government on Friday foiled a court bid by international animal rights activists to stop a Japanese company from killing whales inside the country's Antarctic sanctuary.
Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries--including Japan--maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and add humpback and fin whales to the list.
