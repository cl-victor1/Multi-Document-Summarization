The Philippine government will exhaust all peaceful means to resolve the Sulu hostage crisis since the 20 hostages were abducted from a diving resort in Sabah, Malaysia, the military said Friday.
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado confirmed Wednesday that the hostages abducted from Malaysia had been found in Sulu province, about an hour's boat ride from Sipadan Island, Malaysia where the abduction took place.
The Philippine Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf has threatened to behead some of the 21 hostages they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia because they do not want to talk with a government negotiator.
