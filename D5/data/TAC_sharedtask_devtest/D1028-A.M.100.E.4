The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
Lawyers are set to make opening statements Monday in trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski.
Unabomber killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
Kaczynski, who was arrested in April last year, has pleaded innocent to all charges.
Kaczynski is also charged with another fatal bombing in a separate case in New Jersey.
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. issued that order today in denying a news media motion to make juror names public, according to news reports.
