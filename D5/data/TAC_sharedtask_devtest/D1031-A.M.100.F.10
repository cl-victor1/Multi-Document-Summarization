The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began trickling in.
Mangroves can provide a shield against destructive waves, and the Rome-based agency said there have been specific cases during the recent tsunami where damage and loss of lives were reduced thanks to the mangroves.
At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life.
Mangroves are critical nurseries for many of these fish.
The agency reported one case in Thailand where the mangroves also damaged shallow coral reefs.
