David Kaczynski told the FBI in 1995 that he suspected that his brother was responsible for the attacks after he read a 35,000-word tract from the bomber that was published in The Washington Post.
The manifesto, which was published with joint financing from The New York Times, echoed many of the anti-technology sentiments he had heard his brother express.
In the Sacramento trial Kaczynski is charged in a 10-count indictment covering only four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- so named by the Federal Bureau of Investigation because his first victims were from universities and airlines. --
