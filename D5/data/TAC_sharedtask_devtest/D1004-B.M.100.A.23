The tsunami struck west of Aitape in West Sepik province,hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers) northwest of Port Moresby.
The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7undersea earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages Friday night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on the island of New Guinea, north of Australia, where some people live a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said the villages ofNimas and Warapu also had been swept from a low-lying sand spit into Sissano lagoon.
