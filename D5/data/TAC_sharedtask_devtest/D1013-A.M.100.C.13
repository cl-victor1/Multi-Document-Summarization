Identity theft, one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it to apply for credit.
Within a few months, the identity thief had obtained checks, a driver's license and even business cards in Frank's name.
Most identity fraud starts small, with a few forged checks or purchases on a stolen credit card.
More employers are doing background checks on job applicants because more courts are finding employers liable for not only the actions of employees, but also of former employees.
