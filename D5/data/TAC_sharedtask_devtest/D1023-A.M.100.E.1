LANDECK, Austria _ With more snow covering the Alps than almost anyone could remember, Ulrike Schwarz came to the Austrian Alpine resort of Galtuer from her home in Germany last week with her two teen-age children, expecting the best skiing in years.
Since last weekend, though, it had been snowing too hard to ski.
So Mrs. Schwarz, her daughter, Solvieg, and her son, Christoph, were relaxing in bed on the third floor of their bed-and-breakfast chalet in the center of Galtuer at 4 p.m.
