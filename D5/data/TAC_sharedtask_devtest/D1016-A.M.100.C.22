: The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C. Demonstrators and opposition leaders have been demanding that an investigation be conducted into whether Soeharto and his family accumulated wealth illegally while he was in power.
The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials, former officials and their families.
The Indonesian National Land Agency's Jambi office has uncovered evidence of former President Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth in Central Sumatra Province alone.
