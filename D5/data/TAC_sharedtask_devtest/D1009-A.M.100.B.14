Prosecutors received nearly $80,000 Thursday to help finance the grand jury investigation into the JonBenet Ramsey slaying through March.

Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
