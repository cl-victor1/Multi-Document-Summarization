The Social Security Administration received more than 30,000 complaints about the misuse of Social Security numbers last year; most of the complaints concerned identity theft.
Task force research found that inmates in some states working on government contracts involving telephone contact have used social security numbers to access credit card numbers and other information to commit fraud and harass customers.
Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge accounts or purchase merchandise.
