A small group of people with Parkinson's disease had been pleading for months with the biotechnology company Amgen: Let them resume taking an experimental drug that the patients said had helped them but which the company said was ineffective and possibly dangerous.
Friday Amgen gave its answer: No.
The company said it would not make the drug available to the 48 patients who had participated in its clinical trials, even though the Food and Drug Administration had left the door open for it to do so.
