Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko suggested Friday that the dioxin with which he was poisoned several months ago may have come from outside the country.
"Today there is lots of both direct and indirect proof of how this poison got into Ukraine and to my table," he said at a press conference on the last day allowed for official campaigning before a rerun election being held on Sunday.
