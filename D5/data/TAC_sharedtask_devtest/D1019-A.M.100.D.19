Rescue teams were searching Southeast Asian seas on Tuesday for assailants who abducted 20 hostages from a Malaysian diving resort an attack that Philippine Muslim rebels claimed they carried out.
The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the Philippines, officials said.
Authorities hunted the seas between Malaysia and the Philippines today for two fishing boats controlled by heavily armed men holding 21 hostages they abducted from a Malaysian diving resort two days earlier.
