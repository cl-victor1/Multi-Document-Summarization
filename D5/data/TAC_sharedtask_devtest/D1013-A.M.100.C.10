Identity theft accounts for about half of the $1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret Service, which monitors the crime.
Identity theft, one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses it to apply for credit.
There is now a support group called Victims of Identity Theft (310-397-3004).
In July, a new civil law became effective, forcing credit agencies to clear the records of identity-theft victims who can present a police report documenting the fraud.
