The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field, which was shut down by a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
Statoil's Snorre A platform was hit by a gas leak in a production well that the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority called one of the most serious incidents ever on the Norwegian continental shelf.
No one was injured, but the leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew from Snorre A platform.
State-controlled Statoil blamed poor planning and a failure to follow procedures for the leak.
