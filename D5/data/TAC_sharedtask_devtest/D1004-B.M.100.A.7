Massive high tidal waves powered by strong undersea earthquakes wiped out at least three of 12 affected villages on northwest coast of PNG remote West Sepik province Friday night, leaving 6,000 homeless.
the Rev. Austen Crapp, the administrator of the Catholic Diocese of Aitape, told reporters Monday at a hospital where hundreds of survivors have been treated.
We are going to be sure on one hand we are not causing an undue logistical burden.
Officials said between 6,000 and 10,000 people lived in the area, mostly relying on subsistence farming and fishing.
