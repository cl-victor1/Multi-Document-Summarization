A judge has rejected a plea deal in which a former teacher would have avoided prison time for having sex with a 14-year-old student.
Circuit Judge Hale Stancil on Thursday turned down a plea agreement that would allow Debra Lafave, 25, to avoid a prison sentence.
The victim's mother had said she did not want to put her son through the ordeal of a trial, adding that the media frenzy surrounding the case had been traumatic for her son.
Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County to three years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22
