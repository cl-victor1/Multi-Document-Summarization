David Kaczynski and his wife have been given a $1 million reward from the Justice Department for turning in David's older brother, Theodore, as the Unabomber.
David Kaczynski, an upstate New York social worker, has said that he would give the proceeds of the reward to families of those killed and injured in his brother's 16 bombings over 17 years.
David Kaczynski told the FBI in 1995 that he suspected that his brother was responsible for the attacks after he read a 35,000-word tract from the bomber that was published in The Washington Post.
