The strategy for the first defendant on trial in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard is clear: blame the co-defendant.
The killing ``has literally injected into our community a feeling of guilt.
Russell Henderson, 21, is accused of posing as a homosexual to lure the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6.
Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, are charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted.
The trial is expected to last five weeks.
The prospective jurors will be questioned individually in the judge's chambers.
