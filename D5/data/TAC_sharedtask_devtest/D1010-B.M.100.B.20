WASHINGTON U.S. government officials were trying to trace a cow shipped to the United States from the same Canadian herd as an animal infected with mad cow disease, yet officials said it was unlikely the imported cow had been infected.
In May 2003, when the first Canadian cow tested positive for mad cow disease, officials traced a small number of animals from the same herd to the United States.
