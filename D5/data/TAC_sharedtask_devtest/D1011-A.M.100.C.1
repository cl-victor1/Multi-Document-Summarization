Many baby boomers are in for a big surprise.
"I think baby boomers were taught that if you ate right and took those vitamins and exercised, you were never going to grow old," says Ann Kearney-Cooke.
"Now, all of a sudden, they're getting older and struggling with natural changes".
A baby boomer herself at 49, Kearney-Cooke is a psychologist who has written a book she hopes will help: "Change Your Mind, Change Your Body: Feeling Good About Yourself After Age 40".
