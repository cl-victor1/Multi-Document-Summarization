LARAMIE, Wyo. AP -- Two men who opposed the death penalty were dismissed as potential jurors in the first-degree murder trial of a man charged in the beating death of a gay college student.
In Laramie, where Russell Henderson is on trial for the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard, social service agencies could lose more than 100,000 unless the county can come up with a way to pay for prosecuting and defending Henderson and co-defendant Aaron McKinney.
