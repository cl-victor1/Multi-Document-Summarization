Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing four.
To its credit most recently last weekend.
Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22.
An estimated 1,100 people in the United States become seriously ill each year from eating food contaminated with Listeria.
And that recall was at the end of 1997, the only recall of that year.
