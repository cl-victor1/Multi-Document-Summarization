The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan to resume full production from its Snorre A field, which was shut down by a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
The leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew members from Snorre A, and, although no one was injured, the safety authority called the blowout one of the most serious incidents ever in the Norwegian continental shelf.
The shutdown resulted in a roughly 6.4 percent reduction in the 3.2 million barrel per day production capacity that makes Norway the world's third-largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia.
