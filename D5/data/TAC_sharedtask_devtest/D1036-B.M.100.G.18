Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
Sivkovych, he said, is aligned with Kuchma or Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, the rival to Yushchenko in the presidential race.
Yushchenko has blamed the Ukrainian authorities for poisoning him with dioxin and has called for an investigation.
There's no evidence that Russia was involved in the poisoning, or even that he was poisoned at that dinner.
