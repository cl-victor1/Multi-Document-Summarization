Merck withdrew its Cox-2 drug, Vioxx, from the market last month, citing a study that found it increased the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of use.
The European Medicines Agency said Friday it has been asked by the European Commission to conduct a review of certain arthritis drugs following the worldwide withdrawal of Merck amp Co.'s Vioxx medication.
The agency had no data indicating that Celebrex or Bextra resulted in elevated risks to the heart.
Merck is scheduled to finish a 23,500 patient study that was designed to study cardiovascular safety in early 2006.
