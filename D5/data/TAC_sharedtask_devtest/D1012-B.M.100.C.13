Greek coroners investigating the crash of a Cypriot airliner that killed all 121 people on board ruled out Friday that some may have been made unconscious by carbon monoxide, but were still examining whether other fumes knocked out the crew and passengers.
At least half a dozen people aboard a Cypriot plane were alive when the jetliner carrying 121 people slammed into a hillside north of Athens, Athens' chief coroner said Monday after conducting the first autopsies from the crash.
The pilot did not appear to be in the cockpit, and oxygen masks were seen dangling in the cabin.
