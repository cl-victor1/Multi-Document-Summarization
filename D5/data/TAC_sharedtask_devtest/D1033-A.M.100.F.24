President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Kim said there had been no illicit wiretapping under the government of President Roh Moo-Hyun.
The 19097 conversation is between Hong Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and a top official of the group.
The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal to give three billion won to the then-ruling party chief Lee Hoi-Chang.
Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in the 1997 presidential election.
Lee retired from politics
