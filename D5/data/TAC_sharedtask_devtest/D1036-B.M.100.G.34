Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko said Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
Yushchenko fell ill after having a meal on Sept. 5 with the head of Ukraine's security service, Gen. Ihor P. Smeshko.
Russian and Ukrainian authorities have vehemently denied being involved.
The SBU chief and his deputy were present during the last business dinner but... I don't say that I am directly blaming, or directly suspect these people of my poisoning. Yushchenko
