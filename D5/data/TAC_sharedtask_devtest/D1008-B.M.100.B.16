A 19.4 million plan to reduce pollution and restore bay grasses and oyster habitat to the Corsica River was announced by Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. Tuesday as a ``blueprint'' for saving the Chesapeake Bay.
The cleanup, led by Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C., along with nearly a dozen federal agencies, is known as the Chesapeake Bay Program.
The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster, Crassostrea virginica, @ and an Asian oyster that some officials want to introduce into the bay.
