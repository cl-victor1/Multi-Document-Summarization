Japan on Monday said it would annually kill as many as 935 of the small, non-endangered species, up from 440 this year, under an expansion of the research whaling program it began one year after the IWC banned killing whales for profit.
Conservationists counter that modern scientific means to monitor whale populations mean that, if anything, the cull should be scrapped and non-lethal means used to conduct experiments on the animals.
Whale meat from the research hunts is sold in the Japanese marketplace, NOAA said.
