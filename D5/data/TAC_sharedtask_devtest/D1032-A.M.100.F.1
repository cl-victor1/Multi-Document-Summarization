Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.
"Statoil thinks it will be acceptable to resume partial production from its Snorre A platform in the North Sea," the company said in a statement, adding that, "a partial start-up could take place independently of remaining work with the platform wells".
