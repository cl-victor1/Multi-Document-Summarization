An Air Force study of veterans who sprayed Agent Orange during the Vietnam War found the strongest evidence to date that exposure to the herbicide is associated with diabetes.
The study of 1,000 Air Force veterans who participated in the aerial spraying operation, known during the war as Operation Ranch Hand, found that there were 47 percent more diabetes cases among those who had the highest level of exposure to the herbicide.
Critics says the Air Force has been too slow and too secretive in studying whether the herbicide Agent Orange sickened Vietnam veterans.
