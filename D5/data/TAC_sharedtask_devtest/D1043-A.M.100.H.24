Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday.
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
Syria has been under international pressure to withdraw its troops from Lebanon and not to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs.
On Monday, Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
