In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, still thrives.
Fifteen people, including the two killers, died Tuesday in a shooting and bombing spree at Columbine High School.
Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800 students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate Columbine's overflow.
There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine students and Columbine Valley residents.
