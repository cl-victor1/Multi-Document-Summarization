The Indonesian National Land Agency's Jambi office has uncovered evidence of former President Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth in Central Sumatra Province alone, The Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
Article four of the decree states that efforts to eradicate corruption, collusion and nepotism must be made indiscriminately upon any state officials, former state officials, their families and cronies as well as private businessmen, business tycoons and former president Soeharto.
